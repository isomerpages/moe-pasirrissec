### Students as Inquirers, Teachers as Facilitators of Students’ Learning Experiences

The Science Department is committed to nurturing students who demonstrate a high level of curiosity in Science and a high level of motivation and concentration and can make intuitive leaps in solving Science problems. We also want our students to be able to comprehend abstract concepts beyond age level expectations and see connections between Science and other disciplines.

Our strategy for developing critical and inventive thinking in our students includes the use of Mathematics to define, understand and/or solve problems and teaching students to draw linkages and identify assumptions based on data. We train our students to support their ideas using logical reasoning and to switch methods with ease, in a systematic manner. As for communication, collaboration and information skills, we help to enhance our students' ability to integrate information and concepts into their existing knowledge base and to relate that knowledge base to new problems and topics.

#### Key Programme: Science Experiential, Enrichment and Development Programme (SEED)

This programme aims to promote interest and authentic learning in Science and Technology within and beyond the confines of the classroom. Through this programme, we hope to:

1. develop skills and deepen knowledge so as to enhance students' understanding of scientific concepts

2. develop students' interest and nurture talent in Science and Technology

3. provide students with exposure to current scientific and technological trends

The programme is divided into three tiers: 

#### <center>Enrich, Engage, Excel</center>
