### Programme

The Humanities Department at Pasir Ris Secondary aspires to cultivate a passion for the study of academic disciplines covering human behaviour and culture.

The subjects include Geography, History, Social Studies and Elements of Business. Adopting an Inquiry approach, we prepare our students for the evolving complexities of the globalised world by infusing experiential and hands-on learning opportunities. They do this through various platforms such as Geographical Inquiry and Historical Inquiry projects where they had the chance to research and apply their learning from the respective subject areas.

As part of professional learning, we continue to innovate our instructional programs by using various mobile applications in our teaching and learning. In addition, we continuously seek ways for students to apply what they have learnt in the Humanities curriculum into real life contexts, anchored on contemporary issues.&nbsp;

Since 2015, our school has been on the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Humanities and English Language. This resulted in an increase in the variety of Humanities Subjects offered at the Upper Secondary levels. In addition, a thinking paradigm utilising the Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards was adopted. Together with an emphasis on contemporary issues and broadcast journalism platforms, we aim to develop our students into concerned citizens who will be able to contribute meaningfully back to Singapore.
