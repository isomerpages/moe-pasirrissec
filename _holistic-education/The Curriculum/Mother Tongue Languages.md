**Learn our MTL, Love our MTL, Live out our MTL | Teachers as Learners, Teachers as Leaders**

The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department believes in nurturing Pasirians to:  

* *Learn their MTLs* – Nurture and develop Pasirians to become confident proficient MTL users

#### Mission

**MTL Learning Dispositions**

We seek to develop Pasirians who will be:

* *Self-directed learners* who leverage technology to become proficient users of respective MTLs.
* *Connected learners* who leverage technology to think critically, communicate confidently and learn collaboratively in both written and spoken MTL.
* *Connected learners* who leverage technology in the application of MTL in daily life and to the understanding of contemporary issues.
* *Discerning digital users* who are keenly aware and proud of their cultural heritage (values, history, tradition) and willing to embrace other cultures in Singapore and Asia in the increasingly digitised age.
