### Vision

**Learn our MTL, Love our MTL, Live out our MTL | Teachers as Learners, Teachers as Leaders**

The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department believes in nurturing Pasirians to:  

* Learn their MTLs – Nurture & develop Pasirians to become confident & proficient MTL users
* Love their MTLs – Ignite, deepen & sustain Pasirians’ passion for their MTLs
* Live out their MTLs – Inspire Pasirians to appreciate their MTL values, cultures & heritage, and apply them in their daily lives

### The Mission

The department seeks to equip every student with good listening, speaking, reading & writing skills, so that he / she can become a proficient user of the Mother Tongue Language. We seek to develop in every student a lifelong passion for the Mother Tongue Language, so that he / she can grow to appreciate the beauty therein. We also seek to raise the cultural awareness of students from different races through various cultural programmes and activities, so that they can learn to embrace one another's culture and live in racial harmony in their everyday lives.

### MTL Learning Dispositions

We seek to develop Pasirians who will be:

* Self-directed learners who leverage technology to become proficient users of respective MTLs
* Connected learners who leverage technology to think critically, communicate confidently & learn collaboratively in both written & spoken MTL
* Connected learners who leverage technology in the application of MTL in daily life & to the understanding of contemporary issues   
* Discerning digital users who are keenly aware & proud of their cultural heritage (values, history, tradition) & willing to embrace other cultures in Singapore & Asia in the increasingly digitised & globalised age
