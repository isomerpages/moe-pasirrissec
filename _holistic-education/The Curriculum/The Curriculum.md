The Pasir Ris Secondary School Curriculum is designed and customised for every student segment, and caters to the different learning needs and profiles of students. Through intentional and innovative curriculum design, we seek to nurture T-shaped Pasirians who have the breadth of knowledge and depth of understanding, as well as the requisite learning dispositions to pursue lifelong learning. Through our customised Tiered System of Support (Academic), we endeavour to nurture every Pasirian to their fullest potential.
