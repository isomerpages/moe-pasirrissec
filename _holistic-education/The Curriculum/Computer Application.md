#### Our Teachers adopt the following Teaching strategies: 
  
##### A. Collaborative learning through Pair Work

1.  Collaborative pair work can be used in many situations (e.g. drawing, programming, revision work, etc.
2.  Students take turns to take on the role as either the driver or navigator, and they exchange the roles from time to time.

##### B. S.T.A.R Routine
