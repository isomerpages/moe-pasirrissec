### Programme

The English Language and Literature Department is committed to nurturing confident students who are able to think and read critically and communicate confidently and empathetically in the English language. Our department goals and pedagogies are closely aligned to the 2020 EL syllabus which has three key student outcomes of an empathetic communicator, a discerning reader and a creative inquirer.

The EL department also adopts the CLEARR pedagogical framework from the MOE Curriculum Planning and Development Division in our lesson design, to guide our students to explore various themes and text types through a systematic process, which ensures that they have the productive skills to speak and write accurately and fluently.

Our focus on clear and effective communication is manifested in programmes such as the Drama-in-curriculum Programme for our Secondary One students, as well as the podcast and video projects for alternative assessment in lower secondary. In the classroom, we also encourage our students to express themselves effectively through regular presentations and group discussions. Students are also taught the skills to create media products such photojournalistic articles and posters, which is aligned to the school’s Applied Learning Programme in Journalism.  

In addition, we have developed a comprehensive EL Reading programme, which consists of a series of literary appreciation activities in the library as well as the reading of contemporary issues in the classroom on a regular basis. The students are encouraged to select books from different genres such as realistic fiction, science fiction and action/adventure from recommended book lists. They are also taught to read critically and provide their own personal responses to the characters and issues presented in the books and news articles.

The department has also organised a EL/Lit Festival in Term 2 Week 3 this year where students participated in author’s talks, master classes and exciting library activities to cultivate a joy of learning English Language and Literature. Students also enjoyed the Poetry under the Stars event for our Upper Sec English Literature students to do stargazing and engage in poetry appreciation and writing in the evening.

Our students are also exposed to a variety of opportunities such as the National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) which sees them participating in the Book Trailer, Book Parade and Unseen Debates and the International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) which challenges students who are strong in the language. In addition, we also participate in the Commonwealth Essay Writing Competition and the YMCA Plain English Speaking competition annually.  

In the Literature classroom, students read and respond to a variety of literary texts from the genres of prose, poetry and drama. They also explore different perspectives and give personal responses to different themes on family, culture and society. The texts can range from classics, such as Shakespeare to modern works such as Farenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.

It is our goal to continue to engage our students and to prepare them for the challenging future ahead with 21st century critical thinking and effective communication skills in the English Language.
