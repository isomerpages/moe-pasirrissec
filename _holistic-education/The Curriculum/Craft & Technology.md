<p>The Design &amp; Technology (DT) Unit adopts the DT T&amp;L Framework based on the MOE Syllabus document. The unit aims to instill the design-thinking culture in our students, where empathy, being inquisitive, sketching, critical and creative thinking skills are emphasized in our instructional programme. </p>

### <p>Research and Needs Analysis</p>
<p>Research and investigate to seek real world problems for designing of solutions to meet target users’ needs. </p>
 
<img src="/images/Area%20Survey.jpeg">

### <p>Idea Conceptualization &amp; Development</p>
<p>Use sketching, doodling and any other graphical means to generate, explore, communicate and develop creative and innovative solutions. </p>
  
<img src="/images/ideas.jpeg">

### <p>Prototyping</p>
<p> Learn design manipulating skills to build mock-up models with model making materials and prototype using resistant materials. There is also the opportunity for students to test and evaluate proposed solutions for improvements. </p>

### <p>Signature Program - Makers’ Education</p>  
<p>Since 2019, the D&amp;T Unit has begun to shift in tandem with the national initiative towards “digital”.  As part of the shift, the department has acquired some prototyping capability such as laser cutting equipment, heat press machines and 3D printer. This will “empower” the D&amp;T Unit to gradually incorporate “Makers’ Education” as part of the department’s added focus to expose the students to prototype and test out their “ideas for school improvement” around them. Such opportunities will allow our students to experience a “real life” approach in problem solving as the students are able to “transform” their proposed ideas from sketches/drawings to actual real life application and/or implementation.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div>
	
<p>The Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) Unit adopts the MOE NFS Education Framework. The unit aims to empower students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers; enabling them to better manage their lives for the present and the future. The focus is on how individuals and families optimize their resources of food, finance and time to meet their physical, mental, social and economic needs.</p>
			
<img src="/images/NFS%20Syllabus.png">
			
<p align="center">Source: MOE revised NFS syllabus</p>
			
<p>The unit adopts the inquiry-based pedagogical approach for the teaching and learning of Food Consumer Education (FCE) and Food and Nutrition (F&amp;N).</p>
			
<img src="/images/NFS%20Syllabus_2.png">
			
<p align="center">Source: MOE revised NFS syllabus</p>
			
<p>This approach focuses on providing students with an authentic problem context that allows students to relate and apply the knowledge gained in real-life situations, aligned with the development of 21st Century Competencies. The teaching of FCE and F&amp;N is a cyclical process where students’ engagement with a question or topic leads to intellectual exploration. This eventually leads to an explanation of the feature or process in the question and further leads to the application of their ideas. This process develops the students’ understanding and involves them in their own learning. </p>

<p>This approach will lead to deeper acquisition of nutrition, meal-planning, principles of food science and understanding the link between diet and health. Students will also be equipped with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions concerning food and nutrition.</p>

<p>Programmes to enhance learning experiences of students</p>

* <p>Project Food Culture – Learning Journey to Bollywood Veggies/ hawker centre food</p>
* <p>Supermarket Tour @ NTUC, (Virtual Supermarket Tour was mounted during the Covid-19 period)</p>
* <p>Sustainable Environment - Organic Farming at PRSS Eco-garden</p>
* <p>Culinary workshops by professional chefs for both FCE and F&amp;N students</p>
<p>Annual Tinkers’ Fest Activity – Internal competition; Craft the Cake and Pancake Art.</p>

### <p>Experiential Learning (ExL) in action</p>

### <p>Learning Journey to supermarket</p>

<p>During this period, virtual supermarket visit was mounted where students learn more about comparative shopping and analyzing nutritional claims on a food product.</p>
			
<img src="/images/food2.png">
			
### <p>Urban farming in PRSS</p>

<p>The unit leverages on the revised NFS syllabus to incorporate urban farming as authentic learning experience to understand the importance of Food Security and Sustainability. This will also equip students with new STEM skills/knowledge so that they grow confident in exploring new career opportunities in “High Technology” Farming arenas.</p>

<p>Inquiry-based learning (IBL) helps students learn better as they are involved in an authentic task. As part of their project Food Culture, students were tasked to identify herbs and spices by activating their sense of smell.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div>

<p>At PRSS, we believe that our students have the innate ability to express themselves musically. Through our exciting and comprehensive music programmes, we aim to develop them with musical and extra-musical skills such as critical thinking, psychomotor, social awareness, moral and cultural values. All of these skills and values will lead towards the holistic development of a child.</p>
	
### <p>Music Programmes @PRSS</p>
	
<p>The Lower Secondary Music Syllabus</p>
	
1. <p>Secondary One (Express and Normal Academic)</p>

<p>For 1st semester, our students will experience our signature programme, the STOMP Project module. They learn to compose music and perform their creations to their peers and teachers. Students will showcase their composition during their class performance at the end of this module.</p>
	
<img src="/images/boomwhacker%202.jpeg">

<p>For 2nd semester, they will learn to read musical notations and perform familiar tunes on the boomwhackers. In this module, the classes will get to choose a song and perform during our school’s in-house lunch time concert before the end of this module.</p>
	
2. <p>Secondary Two (Express and Normal Academic)</p>

<p>For 1st semester, our students will learn to play familiar tunes on musical instruments (i.e., ukulele, keyboard, cajon) and collaborate with their peers to perform as a pop band.  </p>

<img src="/images/keyboard%201.jpeg">
	
<p>For 2nd semester, the students would have learnt the fundamentals of playing the instruments and basic structure of typical pop songs. Hence, it is timely to introduce our students to the Songwriting module. In this module, our students will learn to become better songwriters by understanding fundamentals in songwriting. They will have the opportunity to showcase their learning through an assessment of their playing before the end of 2nd semester.</p>
