Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of the holistic, well-rounded education that PRSS seeks to provide. The school has a broad and diverse range of CCAs to cater to the different needs and interests of our students. Through active participation, Pasirians will gain a positive school experience. The CCA experiences will not only provide them with the platform to acquire inter-personal and leadership skills, they also give them the opportunity to thrive for excellence. PRSS leverages on CCAs as a platform for students to develop their character, qualities and be prepared to manage challenging environments.

#### **General Guidelines**

CCA is compulsory for all secondary school students. Students can choose from any of these 4 categories:

• Clubs and societies<br>
• Physical sports<br>
• Uniformed groups<br>
• Visual and performing arts

Students are encouraged to remain in the same CCA throughout their years in PRSS. Transfer between CCAs can only be allowed due to medical reasons.

#### **Participation**  

Students must have a main CCA each year from one of the 4 groups. Points are awarded for participation in the main CCA with at least a&nbsp;**75% attendance rate**.&nbsp;

For students with an attendance rate of 50% - 74%, the CCA points scored for the year will not be computed. However, CCA points accumulated in earlier years can be retained for computation when the student rejoins a CCA and fulfills the 75% attendance rate criterion.

Except for medical reasons, an attendance rate of less than 50% would constitute a break in the CCA, and all points accumulated up to and including that year would be annulled.
