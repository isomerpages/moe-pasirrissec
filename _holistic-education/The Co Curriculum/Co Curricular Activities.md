Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of the holistic, well-rounded education that PRSS seeks to provide. The school has a broad and diverse range of CCAs to cater to the different needs and interests of our students. Through active participation, Pasirians will gain a positive school experience. The CCA experiences will not only provide them with the platform to acquire inter-personal and leadership skills, they also give them the opportunity to thrive for excellence. PRSS leverages on CCAs as a platform for students to develop their character, qualities and be prepared to manage challenging environments.   

  

#### **General Guidelines**

CCA is compulsory for all secondary school students. Students can choose from any of these 4 categories:

  

• Clubs and societies

• Physical sports

• Uniformed groups

• Visual and performing arts

Students are encouraged to remain in the same CCA throughout their years in PRSS. Transfer between CCAs can only be allowed due to medical reasons. 

#### **Participation**

  

Students must have a main CCA each year from one of the 4 groups. Points are awarded for participation in the main CCA with at least a **75% attendance rate**. 

  

For students with an attendance rate of 50% - 74%, the CCA points scored for the year will not be computed. However, CCA points accumulated in earlier years can be retained for computation when the student rejoins a CCA and fulfills the 75% attendance rate criterion. 

  

Except for medical reasons, an attendance rate of less than 50% would constitute a break in the CCA, and all points accumulated up to and including that year would be annulled.
