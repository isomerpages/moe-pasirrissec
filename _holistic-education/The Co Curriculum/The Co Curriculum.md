The Co-Curriculum is an integral part of the Pasirian Experience. Pasir Ris Secondary School places equal emphasis on the Co-Curriculum, where the two key vehicles: **Co-Curricular Activities and Character and Citizenship Education**, provide the foundation and platforms for the inculcation and application of desired skills, attitudes and values. 

The wide range of [Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)](/cca/co-curricular-activities/), consisting of 17 different clubs from 4 different CCA groups such as Performing Arts Groups, Sports Groups, Uniformed Groups and Clubs and Society ensures that we can cater to students' varied interests and strengths. 

[Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)](/holistic-education/the-co-curriculum/character-and-citizenship-education), on the other hand, is conducted across multiple platforms, focusing on key areas such as Cyber Wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), National Education (NE) and Values-In-Action (VIA).
