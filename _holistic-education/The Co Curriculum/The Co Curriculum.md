The Co-Curriculum is an integral part of the Pasirian Experience. Pasir Ris Secondary School places equal emphasis on the Co-Curriculum, where the two key vehicles - Co-Curricular Activities, and Character and Citizenship Education, provide the foundation and platforms for the inculcation and application of desired skills, attitudes and values. The wide range of Co-Curricular Activities, consisting of 17 different Clubs, Performing Arts, Sports, and Uniformed Groups, ensures that we can cater to studentsâ€™ varied interests and strengths. Character and Citizenship Education, on the other hand, is conducted across multiple platforms, focusing on key areas, such as Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, National Education and Values-In-Action.
