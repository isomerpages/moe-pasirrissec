<h4><strong>Blended Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Blended Learning will continue in Term 3 and students will participate
in at least 1 hour of Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) activity to explore
an area of interest beyond the curriculum.</p>
<p>For Sec 4 and 5 students, SIL is optional and they may use the time to
prepare for the National Examinations instead.</p>
<p>Please look out on the <a href="/Announcements/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Announcements</a> for more details.

<p>For Parents</p>
<p>Blended Learning is part of MOE’s efforts to further develop our students’
ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. Home-Based
Learning Days will be scheduled about once a fortnight to complement teaching
and learning in school. We hope to partner you by inculcating in our students
the skills to self-manage and take ownership for their own learning.</p>
<p>Do refer to the <strong>Parent Resource Kits</strong> below which provides
general information and tips on HBL Days, a part of the BL structure, and
how you can support your child on their HBL days.</p>
