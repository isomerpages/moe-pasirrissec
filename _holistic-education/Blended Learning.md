#### For Parents

\[Updated on 25 January 2022\]

  

Dear Parents, 

  

Blended Learning (BL) is part of MOE’s efforts to further develop our students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. Home-Based Learning (HBL) Days will be scheduled about once a fortnight to complement teaching and learning in school. We hope to partner you by inculcating in our students the skills to self-manage and take ownership for their own learning.

  

Do refer to the **Parent Resource Kits** (click on links below) provides general information and tips on HBL Days, a part of the BL structure, and how you can support your child on their HBL days.

  
Thank you.
