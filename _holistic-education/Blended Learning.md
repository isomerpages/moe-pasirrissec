#### **Blended Learning**

Blended Learning will continue in Term 3 and students will participate in at least 1 hour of Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) activity to explore an area of interest beyond the curriculum.

For Sec 4 and 5 students, SIL is optional and they may use the time to prepare for the National Examinations instead. 

Please look out on the [Announcements](/Announcements/) for more details.

<p> Blended Learning (BL) is part of MOE’s efforts to further develop our students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. Home-Based Learning (HBL) Days will be scheduled about once a fortnight to complement teaching and learning in school. We hope to partner you by inculcating in our students the skills to self-manage and take ownership for their own learning.</p>

<p>Do refer to the <b>Parent Resource Kits</b> below which provides general information and tips on HBL Days, a part of the BL structure, and how you can support your child on their HBL days.</p>
