At Pasir Ris Secondary School, we have a whole range of programmes and CCAs that cater to your interest in digital media. Through our school’s Experiencing Coding Programme and Makers Programme, you will be given the space and opportunities for creativity and innovation to address authentic and real-world challenges that we face in our daily lives, through coding, mobile app writing, robotics, maker workshops, and activities. In addition, the school’s Tinkers Club CCA will also be actively engaging you in coding and makers related competitions and events within and beyond the school. 

  

For students who are interested in videography or photography, the Audio Visual Lights Club (AVL) will also provide you with the platform and in-house training to strengthen digital media skills, such as creating and curating videos, photos, and animation, audio, and perform post-production editing. This will enable you to express yourself effectively through digital media means and put your views across to others on various real-world issues, such as climate change. You will also be placing these skills to the test by serving in various school events coverage and gaining other soft skills, personal qualities, and attitudes, such as prioritization, time management, and resilience.  

  

In our lower secondary integrated project work, you will also be able to work on solutions to real-world issues via digital media means too. You may be working on a Microbit project to provide visual and audio warnings to those who exercising that the surrounding temperature is too warm. You can write a mobile app to teach the elderly about good personal hygiene habits. You will be creating a video or a series of photos to send a clear signal to others that cyberbullying is harmful. The possibilities are endless.

  

If you have a keen interest and talent for Coding, Makers Movement, Robotics, Videography, or Photography, we invite you to join our Pasirian family.
