PRSS extends our warmest invitation to all Primary 6 students to apply for direct admission to our Secondary One via the Direct School Admission (DSA – Sec) Exercise. 

At PRSS, we embrace the arts and have a vibrant artistic culture. You will have a CCA experience of a lifetime by participating in our Performing Arts groups, which include the Choir, Concert Band, Chinese Orchestra, Drama, and Modern Dance. We aim for all our Pasirians to be cultured citizens, reflective learners, and creative performers. You will have the opportunity to immerse yourself in the arts, creating and experimenting with different art forms, while achieving artistic excellence.

In addition to the regular practices during CCA days, you will extend your talents and interests through exchanges with other institutions, masterclasses, and camps. We will groom you to be confident performers through the numerous performance opportunities. Our Pasirians have participated in prominent national and regional performances such as Spring Surprise at Gardens by the Bay, Limelight at the Esplanade, A Beautiful Life at Victoria Concert Hall, and Arts Fiesta at Tampines Hub. Our Performing Arts groups have been consistent top performers at the Biennial Singapore Youth Festival.

With our firm belief in maximizing our Pasirians’ potential, talented Pasirians will be offered a place in our Music Accreditation Program with ABRSM / NAFA.

If you are talented in Music and the Performing Arts and wish to shine in a supportive environment, we invite you to join our Pasirian family.
