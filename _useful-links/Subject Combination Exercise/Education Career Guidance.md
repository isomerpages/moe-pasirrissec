<h4>MySkillsFuture Student Portal - Support for Our Students</h4>

“What do you want to be when you grow up?”<br>

Choosing one's education or career path is one of the most important yet
difficult decisions to make. Students need to be able to make well-informed
choices by talking to their parents, home teachers, subject teachers and/or
school ECG counsellor about their education and career aspirations. They
can also explore and gather information via the MOE Education and Career
Guidance e-portal at [www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/index.html)
