We strongly encourage parents to discuss with your child/ward on his/her interests, learning styles and explore possible tertiary options. Your child/ward may see the Home Teachers or the Education and Career Guidance officer, Mr Mohammed Syahril Bin Samsudin whom he/she can make an appointment with to explore his/her possible options. Mr Syahril is on-site in Pasir Ris Secondary School on Mondays and Thursdays during term time.
