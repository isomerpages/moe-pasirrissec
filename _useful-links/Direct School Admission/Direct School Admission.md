<p>Pasir Ris Secondary School is in an exciting stage of growth. We would
like to extend our warmest invitation to all Primary 6 students to apply
for direct admission to our Secondary One via the DSA-Sec Direct School
Admission Exercise.&nbsp;Here are the 3 categories of DSA Talent Areas
students can apply to:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;<strong><a href="/useful-links/direct-school-admission-dsa/dsa-llp-in-music-and-performing-arts/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Learning for Life Programme in Music &amp; Performing Arts</a></strong>&nbsp;
- At PRSS, we embrace the love of aesthetics and have a vibrant culture
in the Music and Performing Arts. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
in music and performing arts is a broad-based programme encapsulated in
‘SHINE’ which comprises 5 key areas:&nbsp; Self-discovery of interest and
ability, Heritage &amp; cultural appreciation, Interaction &amp; Collaborative
learning, eNgagement in community outreach &amp; partnership and Excellence
in artistic expression. Through music and the performing arts, we hope
to cultivate sound values, social-emotional competencies and character
in our students and help them to pursue their passion and talent in aesthetics.
The Performing Arts CCAs in our school include the Choir, Concert Band,
Chinese Orchestra, Drama and the Modern Dance.</p>
<p>b) <strong><a href="/useful-links/direct-school-admission-dsa/dsa-talent-development-in-sports/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Talent Development in Sports - Football (Boys) and Volleyball (Boys &amp; Girls)</a></strong>&nbsp;–
new in 2020, our school has many alumni who embrace sports for life and
are doing well in careers related to sports. As such, we are building on
the tradition to grow sporting talents at our school. We have a comprehensive
and extensive programme in Football and Volleyball to develop our athletes.
Not only do they receive high-quality training in sports, but there is
also a robust leadership programme to develop them into worthy sports ambassadors.
We strongly believe that sports can build character, foster friendship
and teamwork.&nbsp;If you have a strong passion for Football or Volleyball
and have represented your primary school in sports competitions, do join
us!</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;<strong><a href="/useful-links/direct-school-admission-dsa/dsa-digital-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Media</a></strong> -
Our school has been on MOE pilot for the PDLP (Personal Digital Learning
Programme) in 2019 and we have set up a programme to nurture students’
talent and interest in digital media. This programme is different from
the ALP as it will include AVL (Audio Visual &amp; Lighting) support and
service to school and talent development in digital media including video
recording, broadcasting, photography, coding, computational thinking and
makerspace programme. Here, students undergo training on different digital
media and get to create interesting prototypes such as block programming
with mBots and micro bits using principles of design thinking.</p>
