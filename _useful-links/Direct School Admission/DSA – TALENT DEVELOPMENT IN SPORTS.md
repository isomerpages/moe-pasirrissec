Did you know that Pasir Ris Secondary has a number of outstanding alumni in sports? Yasir Hanapi, a SEA Games Bronze Medallist in 2007 and 2009, and Ethel Kang, a SEA Games Bronze Medallist for Indoor Volleyball in 2015, are two alumni who have gone on to excel in their sporting journey and career. Leveraging the pervasiveness of these two sports in the school’s tradition, we are recruiting exceptional talents to join our Football and Volleyball teams.

At Pasir Ris Secondary School, we have a comprehensive and extensive programme in Football and Volleyball to develop our athletes. Not only do they receive high-quality training in sports, but there is also a robust leadership programme to develop them into worthy sports ambassadors. Some of the leadership opportunities include assignment as assistant coaches during PE lessons, nomination as sports captains, attendance at sports clinics/masterclasses, championing health and fitness as well as organising inter-class games. We strongly believe that sports can build character, and foster friendship and teamwork. We will ensure that our athletes balance their achievements in sports and academic studies.

With a firm belief in pushing every individual to his/her potential, for exceptional performers, there are opportunities to link up with clubs for them to participate at a higher level of play.

If you have the passion and talent for Football or Volleyball, we invite you to join our Pasirian family.
