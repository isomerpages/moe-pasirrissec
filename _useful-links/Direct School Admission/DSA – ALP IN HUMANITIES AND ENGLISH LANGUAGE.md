<h4><strong>EYE ON THE WORLD: STORIES THROUGH JOURNALISM</strong></h4>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme in Humanities and English Language aims
to develop you to be an all-rounded student with a good knowledge of contemporary
issues. In particular, we hope to nurture you as one who is a discerning
reader and a critical thinker and inquirer of knowledge, with the ability
to communicate your ideas effectively through journalism platforms such
as radio podcasts and photojournalism.</p>
<p>You will discover the joy of learning English Language and Humanities
subjects such as Geography, History, and Social Studies through exciting
opportunities to explore and learn about real-world issues. Recent topics
that have been covered in our programme include inter-generational relationships,
sustainable living, and a cashless society. These topics will be covered
in and outside class in an engaging way where students complete current
affairs quizzes, analyse articles, watch relevant videos and provide their
own personal responses, which will be featured in our very own <strong>#Ruminate Gallery</strong>.
You will also have the opportunity to research and work on projects which
make a difference to the community!</p>
<p>At the same time, we will also hone your skills in research, media literacy,
writing, photography, visual text production, and oral presentation in
the various projects that you undertake with your peers. Apart from that,
there will be customised workshops where you will be equipped with relevant
skills in dramatic expressions and media production. These activities will
enable you to think broadly, appreciate multiple perspectives, and be more
confident in the delivery and articulation of your ideas through creative
digital platforms. You will also be part of our PRSS Morning Waves radio
programme which is broadcasted once a week, where you can design a ‘radio
show’ to share your opinions on real-world issues like Covid-19 and racial
harmony with your teachers and schoolmates.</p>
<p>Join us too, on our learning journeys to media organisations such as production
studios, SPH and MediaCorp and take part in exciting competitions and conferences
such as model United Nations and poster, photo, and video-making competitions
so that you can appreciate the relevance of what you learn and have an
opportunity to spar with students from other learning institutions.</p>
<p>If you have an interest and passion for learning more about Broadcast
Journalism, Photojournalism, or Media Production, we invite you to join
our Pasirian family.</p>
