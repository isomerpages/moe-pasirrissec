Childhood and adolescent years are crucial to set the foundation for healthy growth. Eating a nutritionally balanced diet supports optimal growth and development. By encouraging healthy eating habits now, we can give our students the best opportunity to grow into healthy adults.

  

HPB has developed a Parents’ Booklet to encourage parents to nurture healthy eating habits at home. Together with the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme, we aim to promote the consumption of healthy meals with a balanced mix of the four different food groups – brown rice, whole grain noodles and wholemeal bread; fruit and vegetables as well as meat and alternatives, both in school and at home.
