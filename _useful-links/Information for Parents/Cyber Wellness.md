Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and being aware of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW in our schools is to help children navigate cyberspace, respectfully, safely and responsibly. They should also be a positive peer influence by using technology to enhance collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocate the positive use of technology.

MOE has also developed other CW resources for parents, such as guides and tips related to ‘Scams’ and ‘Danger with Cyber Contacts’, as well as C-Quest, a resource to help parents talk about CW with their children.  You can access all these resources on MOE’s ICT Connection website  [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/cyber-wellness) .
