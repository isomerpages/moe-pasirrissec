“ _Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success._ ”

                                                                                                                                              - Henry Ford

This famous quote was often shared by members of our PSG Exco.  It goes well with our Partnership Framework of fostering synergistic partnership for win-win outcomes.
