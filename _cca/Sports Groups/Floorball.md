### **About us**

2024 marks the beginning of our Floorball CCA journey, starting with our Secondary 2 boys from the various CCA groups. From 2025, Floorball (Boys) is offered as one of the Sports CCAs.

Our members are guided by our team ethos of: Positive Winning **Attitude**, **Basics** to Perfection, **Communication**, **Discipline**, **Enthusiasm**, **Focus** and **Grit**. 
Our training framework which revolves around our A,B,Cs and 1, 2, 3s aims to develop our students into accomplished Sportsmen and Gentlemen who ***Play Hard, Play Smart and Play Together.***

### **Highlights**

Our boys participated in our maiden National School Games Floorball Championships in 2024 (C-Division Boys) League 3. 
We participatied at the U14 Pesta Sukan Floorball Challenge (Quarter-Finals) and U17 Pesta Sukan Floorball Challenge (Preliminary Round) in July. 
We also grew as a team through our participation at the  U16 Youth Floorball League (November, December 2024).
Participation at the NSG and external competitions have provided our boys with a holistic CCA experience.
