### **About us**

In Pasir Ris Secondary School, 2024 marks the beginning of our Floorball CCA program. This year we are starting with our Secondary 2 boys from the various CCA groups. Floorball (Boys) will be offered as one of the Sports CCA for Secondary One students from 2025. Our members are guided by our team ethos of: Positive Winning **Attitude**, **Basics** to Perfection, **Communication**, **Discipline**, **Enthusiasm**, **Focus** and **Grit**. Our training framework which revolves around our A,B,Cs and 1, 2, 3s aims to develop our students into accomplished Sportsmen and Gentlemen who ***Play Hard, Play Smart and Play Together***.
