### **About us**

2024 marks the beginning of our Floorball CCA program. This year we are starting with our Secondary 2 boys from the various CCA groups.

Our members are guided by our team ethos of: Positive Winning **Attitude**, **Basics** to Perfection, **Communication**, **Discipline**, **Enthusiasm**, **Focus** and **Grit**. Our training framework which revolves around our A,B,Cs and 1, 2, 3s aims to develop our students into accomplished Sportsmen and Gentlemen who ***Play Hard, Play Smart and Play Together***.
