### **About us**

#### <strong>PRSS Football: Built on Passion, Driven by Brotherhood</strong> 

At PRSS Football, every player steps onto the field with one mission — to give everything for the team. Our spirit is defined by determination, discipline, and the will to never give up. From the moment the whistle blows, we play with intensity, always ready to take charge or fight our way back no matter the score.

Training twice a week, we pour effort into every drill and take every piece of feedback seriously. Improvement is our constant goal, and we push one another to grow stronger — physically, mentally, and as a team.

What sets us apart is our unity. On the field, we move as one. Off the field, we look out for one another like brothers. Before every match, our trademark battle cry — “WoooHaaa!” — echoes across the pitch, a powerful reminder of our focus and fire.

This year, we’re proud to uphold our reputation as one of the Top 8 football schools in Singapore (C Division) for the third consecutive year. This achievement reflects the hard work, resilience, and unwavering spirit that define our team.

PRSS Football is more than a CCA — it’s a family bound by respect, effort, and pride. Every match, every training, every shout of “WoooHaaa!” brings us closer as one team ready to take on any challenge.
