### **About us**

#### Where Music **CO**nquers

Pasir Ris Secondary School Chinese Orchestra (PRSSCO) is committed to developing Pasirians into confident and independent learners who are motivated to always put their best foot forward. PRSSCO advocates care for each other and teamwork and discipline are crucial values of an orchestra.

As one of the premier school Chinese Orchestras in Singapore, we seek to develop our students into competent and credible musicians. Through regular performance opportunities, learning journeys and workshops, we aim to deepen and extend music learning and experiences. Students also have the opportunities to create their own arrangements and perform in small ensembles. With the support of our LLP, our Music Accreditation Programme seeks primarily to develop the talents of our Chinese Orchestra members by providing strong support for the enhancement and accreditation of musical skills.

Since the commencement of the PRSSCO Niche Programme in Chinese Orchestra in 2008, PRSSCO has delivered outstanding performances at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival, garnering 3 consecutive Gold with Honours awards from 2007 to 2011 and the Certificates of Distinctions from 2013 to 2019. PRSSCO was also appointed the inaugural Music Talent Development Centre for Chinese Orchestras from 2009 to 2014.

We welcome parents and prospective students to check out our Instagram and TikTok @prssco\_\_ for updates and events in PRSSCO.
