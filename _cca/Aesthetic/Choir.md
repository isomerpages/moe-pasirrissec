### About us

The PRSS Choir aims to build a family of choristers with character and skills who is self-directed to achieve a high standard of performance that celebrates cultural diversity. With the motto of **“Many Voices, One Harmony”**, the choir prides herself by working together as a family where no member is left behind. The choir believes in deepening one’s values, developing self-confidence and honing of leadership skills. These qualities reflect the school’s belief in the importance of developing confident and well-rounded individuals as they contribute actively to the music culture in school.

In 2010, the choir found new direction from a SSA (Female Choir) to SATB Mixed Choir under the baton of Mr. Terrence Toh. Over time, the choir grew from strength to strength and obtained her first SYF Gold Award as an SATB Choir in 2011. Subsequently, in 2013, the choir was awarded a Certificate of Distinction in the biennial SYF Arts Presentation, a feat repeated in 2015, 2017 and 2019, establishing itself as a performing arts group with immense potential and promise. With ample opportunities and a rich diversity of learning experiences created for every member, both locally and overseas over the years, the choir hopes in bringing out the best in every child apart from discovering their musical talents and appreciation for music.
