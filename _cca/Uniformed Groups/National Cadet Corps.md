About US
--------

The NCC provides a wide range of opportunities and unique experiences for our students to build character, develop leadership and lifeskills and most importantly, build and deepen commitment towards our nation. All cadets participate in core activities that strengthen their character and develop their leadership skills, for example, basic survival training, Camp FORGE (teambuilding camp for Sec 1) and Camp STEEL (leadership camp for Sec 2). For the cadet leaders in upper secondary, they can look forward to advanced survival training at Mt Ophir and also advanced leadership training through the Specialist Course. With strong support from MINDEF and SAF, our cadets are able to acquire military-related skills such as Individual Field Craft and Marksmanship Training with the SAR-21 rifle.

Highlights
----------

To develop our cadets with a global mindset, the NCC has a comprehensive International Cadet Exchange Programmes that bring the cadet leaders and senior cadet leaders to countries such as Australia, the Maldives, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Selected senior cadet leaders will also witness SAF’s capabilities when they embark on visits to overseas military exercises such as Exercise Thunder Warrior in New Zealand and Exercise Panzer Strike in Germany. To date, 4 of our cadets have been selected by NCC HQ to go for such exchange programmes.

  

Freestyle Drill Exhibition (FSD) competition has always been the niche of PRSS NCC unit. Our unit has been placed the top 4 positions in the East District for the past 3 years. The exciting annual competition fosters creativity, teamwork, resilience and discipline that are hallmarks of a NCC Cadet. In this competition, cadets are required to choreograph the drill movements and promote creativity to make drill fun but yet challenging.
