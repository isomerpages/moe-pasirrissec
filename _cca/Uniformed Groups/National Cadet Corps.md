### **About Us**

The NCC provides a wide range of opportunities and unique experiences for our students to build character, develop leadership and lifeskills and most importantly, build and deepen commitment towards our nation. All cadets participate in core activities that strengthen their character and develop their leadership skills, for example, basic survival training, Camp FORGE (teambuilding camp for Sec 1) and Camp STEEL (leadership camp for Sec 2). For the cadet leaders in upper secondary, they can look forward to advanced survival training at Mt Ophir and also advanced leadership training through the Specialist Course. With strong support from MINDEF and SAF, our cadets are able to acquire military-related skills such as Individual Field Craft and Marksmanship Training with the SAR-21 rifle.

### **Highlights**

Both our units, NCC Boys and NCC Girls have attained the Distinction Award every year since 2018. We have good results from Annual Sports Competition, with our Sec 1 Boys and Sec 2 Girls unit placing 4th in Nationals.
Freestyle Drill Exhibition (FSD) competition has always been the niche of PRSS NCC unit. The exciting annual competition fosters creativity, teamwork, resilience and discipline that are hallmarks of a NCC Cadet. In this competition, cadets are required to choreograph the drill movements and promote creativity to make drill fun but yet challenging.<br>
We are also growing our Precision Drill Squad (PDS) starting in 2025, inviting interested students to join and train precision drills with rifles. Courses organised by HQ will also be offered to them as they advance in their proficiency.
