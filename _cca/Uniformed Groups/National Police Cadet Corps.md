About us
--------

**“Only the Best wear Blue”.**

Pasir Ris Secondary NPCC Unit believe in developing our cadet’s character, leadership and resilience. Hence, our unit motto is Nurturing Leaders of Tomorrow. We will always ensure that all the cadets will have a fulfilling experience discovering about themselves and learning skills that will be useful for the future.  

This year, some of our cadets are gearing up in preparation for the HQ competitions such as the Drills Competition and Campcraft competition. It is also our pride to achieve our 16th consecutive year Gold Award for the Unit Overall Proficiency Award, (UOPA) in 2019 and 12th position in the NPCC Drill Competition.

Some of our unit programs includes the 0.22 revolver shooting, Crime Scene Investigation Course, Kayaking Course, First Aid Course and many more. 

In 2022, we are proud to be selected to representing NPCC in the Actual National Day Parade at The Float @ Marina Bay. 20 cadets will be representing the school and NPCC for this once in a life time opportunity.
