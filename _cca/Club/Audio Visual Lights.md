### **About us**

#### **SERVE, SHOOT and CREATE**

The Audio Visual and Lights Club (AVL) focuses on three main areas: SERVE, SHOOT and CREATE!

In SERVE, members support the school by providing essential Audio-Visual (AV) assistance for events like National Day celebrations and the Graduation Ceremony.

In SHOOT, members develop their photography and videography skills through structured courses and hands-on training. They use these skills in AV projects and serve as photographers for school events.

In CREATE, members enhance their post-production editing skills to produce high-quality photos and videos that engage and impress audiences.
