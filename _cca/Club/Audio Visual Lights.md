### **About us**

#### **SERVE, SHOOT and CREATE**

The Audio Visual and Lights Club (AVL) is dedicated to three main core areas:&nbsp;**SERVE, SHOOT and CREATE**! Within SERVE, AVL members actively contribute to the school and her community by offering indispensable Audio-Visual (AV) support for a range of school events such as National Day celebrations and Graduation Ceremony. In SHOOT, members acquire and refine their photography and videography skills through a combination of structured courses and hands-on training sessions. They apply these skills while participating in various AV projects, serving as photographers for both school and community events. Additionally, members delve into the art of post-production editing to CREATE exceptional-quality photographs and videos that captivate audiences.
