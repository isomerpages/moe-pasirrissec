### About us

**Let's do Crafting &amp; Coding! **

At Tinkers Club, students learn about crafting and coding. As we live in an IT savvy environment, it is essential for students to learn about coding and know the basic fundamentals of creating a program using block coding softwares and microcontrollers. Crafting is also another essential skill that we want students to acquire. Students will learn to be creative and innovate their own prototypes using modelling materials and crafting equipment. These programmes are to allow students to be future ready, where innovation and basic IT knowledge is very much essential in their daily lives.
