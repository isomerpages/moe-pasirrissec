### **About us**

A storm has been brewing in a teacup for the past two years during COVID-19. The hiatus was trying. With online training and no opportunity to play due to social distancing, many netballers had to bite their lips and simply continue their mundane training. Thankfully, with the fixtures in place for the different games, things began to pick up. This year, our Netball girls started their journey during the December holidays by attending the Netball festival. Before the National School Games (NSG), we also got to host a couple of friendly games. This offered a golden opportunity for our C Division to glean some experience for their NSG. In the second quarter of the year, we also participated in the Schoolâ€™s Challenge League 2023 to further hone our ball-handling skills. Finally, the highlight of this year was our farewell for our Secondary 4 seniors. All good things must come to an end, we wish our seniors all the best for the next phase of their lives and we look forward to another challenging and rewarding year in 2024!

### **Highlights**

Besides the annual NSG for B and C Division, we are also participating in the School Challenge League. Hence, during CCA we get to spar with other schools in mini-competitions.

### **Achievements**

We are helping out our neighbouring Yumin Primary school to have friendly matches with their upper primary team to condition them for their NSG. By doing so we are also indirectly talent spotting for our future team.
