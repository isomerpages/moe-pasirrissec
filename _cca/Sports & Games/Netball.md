About us

**Passion & Resilience**

  

That is how we play our game. 

  

With much passion, we keep up with our fitness routines despite the challenging days during school closure in mid-2020 due to the pandemic through E-CCA Zoom sessions. We are able to adapt despite the limitation of space and resources as we push through our online training together. 

  

Our traditional bonding session was replaced by an online sharing of students about their favorite snacks. A student team leader then shared how we can consciously choose healthier alternatives to snack. It was an engaging session for everyone as we share common favorites. 

  

With much resilience, we paced through the days and appreciated our physical trainings again on court. Together as a team we can grow stronger.
