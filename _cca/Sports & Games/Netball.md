### About us

We are a team of girls passionate about netball. Together with our coach we train for National School Games B and C divisions. This year we are also participating in the School Challenge League. Come join us and develop your physical strength and mental perseverance.

### Highlights

Besides the annual NSG for B and C Division, we are also participating in the School Challenge League. Hence, during CCA we get to spar with other schools in mini-competitions.

### Achievements

We are helping out our neighbouring Yumin Primary school to have friendly matches with their upper primary team to condition them for their NSG. By doing so we are also indirectly talent spotting for our future team.
