This session seeks to share with participants the Music Unit's approach in engaging Secondary 1s in a synchronous music making activity, and the thought processes that takes place during the planning. The concepts that we are sharing are generically applicable to all skill-based and creative subjects.
|CS1\_LT\_2|[Using ICT for Coursework-based Subjects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uf9qP200fxPUkTe4uPtnZYnycJG5vaM9/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Lee Kwee Wei<br>Mdm Tan Shin Shin  <br>Mdm Warda Md Sharif  <br>**(Tampines Secondary School)**|Craft & Technology|The Craft & Technology Department will be sharing their journey on the use of Google Suite applications and SLS in D&T, Art and FCE subjects so as to promote effective learning and active collaboration amongst students.
|CS1\_LT\_3|[Use of Visible Thinking Routines (VTR) to generate ideas for expository writing with ICT  for diverse learners](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZZHHgBOgiuRamr0Nu3EFcWzSM9p4THUV/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Loy Lin Li Lynn  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|English Language|The English language syllabus (Curriculum Planning and Development Division) outlines the teaching of writing as having three stages – the generation and selection of ideas, development and organisation of ideas, and review, revision and editing. This study focuses on the first stage – the generation and selection of ideas – as this is a crucial stage which determines the extent to which the next two stages can be effectively executed. Participants will gain an understanding of how the intentional coupling of appropriate ICT tools with strategies drawn from ‘Making Thinking Visible’ by Ritchhart, Church and Morrison and Visible Thinking by Project Zero enable our Secondary Three diverse learners to generate and select relevant ideas for expository writing.
|CS1\_LT\_4|[Understanding the Factors of Diversity through the Use of SLS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13cFlJX73yd4sQ2H0dV44yQVqND68Fy4Z/view?usp=sharing)|Miss Yap Su Fen   <br>Mdm Hairunisa Hosnin  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Social Studies|In this presentation, we will share how we leverage SLS to scaffold our students learning of a brand new issue in Social Studies about Diversity. Students have to explore four factors contributing to the diversity in our society. Students were given recorded lectures and notes, plus additional videos and other interactive elements to help them with their understanding of the chapter. SLS allowed them to go through the chapter in parts, making it easier for them to manage the new content.|
|CS1\_LT\_5|[Active Learning in Mathematics Using Technology to Support Assessment for Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XyZ0hIW7f4GUkBSej747ZzT1BRL8ZeTm/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Noor Azean Binte Khamis  <br>**(Ngee Ann Secondary School)**|Mathematics|Using digital manipulatives, students are able to visualise and gain a better understanding of topics related to Geometry. While students are encouraged to explore and complete structured tasks and take ownership of their learning, teachers can also view students’ progress in real time, provide feedback and facilitate discussions.|
|CS1\_LT\_6|[What makes a Singaporean?- An inquiry based learning experience through vlogging](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N1z_iqIdixX_IFeS518AAq9aViyxtNLZ/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Anmilia Bte Anwar Datt   <br>Mdm Fazidah Bte Mohd Lias  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Malay Language  <br>(Presentation in Malay)|This vlogging project is an inquiry based learning experience where students engage actively in content creation for presentation. It also aims to trigger students’ curiosity in current issues for deeper understanding and global awareness. By adopting Making Thinking Visible as a strategy, SLS lessons were designed to scaffold students’ learning through research. The use of ICT tools (SLS / Vlog) and authentic learning experiences, enables students to generate relevant ideas and engage in evidence based reasoning. Students collaboratively presented their findings through a vlog.
|CS1\_LT\_7|[ICT for Collaboration and Feedback in the Physically Distanced Science Classroom](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nFfLNPKjrKrfv4MlhSjQGrGvnKEtdAaF/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Nicholas Lim<br>Mr Shyamsuraj Yadav<br>**(Tanjong Katong Girls' School)**|Science|Simple yet powerful ICT tools like Whiteboard.fi and Google Jamboard enable multi-way communication using text, drawings or images, between users of smartphones or computers. We will showcase how this was infused effectively in the teaching and learning of Sciences, where these tools bridge the physical distance between teacher and learners in the HBL setting, and also in the physical classroom constrained by safe distancing requirements. Used appropriately, they maximize student collaboration and participation, reduce the delay in addressing difficulties and learning gaps, enable real-time feedback, and aid teachers in efficient and targeted assessment for learning. Besides introducing teachers to new ICT tools, we aim to stimulate further exploration, experimentation and innovation in the use of widely available ICT tools to bridge distances in our physical and virtual learning environments for collaboration and effective feedback.
|CS1\_LT\_8|[Enhancing content of picture composition through use of visible thinking and developing F.A.S.T](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12c5UCKvClVdOBmdSDgGtkjk6BB1QisLP/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Grace Seah Pei Ru<br>Ms Lim Tian Jing<br>**(Waterway Primary School)**|Chinese Language|Students always struggle with content-rich picture composition as they lack good vocabulary to start with. This sharing focuses on using a strategy F.A.S.T on the main characters well as leveraging on Padlet and SLS as a means for students to collaborate to build a repository of vocabulary. This helps to promote visible and deeper thinking, enabling students to have better vocabulary to connect the pictures and provide a more content-rich story.

The team was exploring ways to allow for the application of essential traits in Humanities in a separate  medium. The Radio show seeks to develop confidence in expression and an awareness of contemporary issues among our students. Traditional mediums such as stand-up speeches or Oral component practices are limited and time-consuming. The Radio show format is not only a medium that our students are comfortable in but it also allows them to develop oracy skills while at the same time groom them to become confident English Language users who are  aware of global and local issues.
|CS1\_AL\_3| [Excite Engage Experience – CL Alive (EᶟCA)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqNRdGpZtz8VcUhtKWHueBOfHe3Ao7xJ/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Wang Qi<br>Ms Ho Wai Wai<br>**(St. Hilda's Primary School)**| Chinese Language|Joy of learning is the overarching initiative behind this experiential learning. CL teachers design learning activities with props and transform the classroom into different real life scenarios that focus on speaking and listening. This provides opportunities for students to engage others using their CL in an immersive and authentic environment.
|CS1\_AL\_4|[Explore and Discover the Outdoors! – Learning beyond the classroom](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opAARlX0ka8ZGWVIEYNM8m_i9U1iN0Nw/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Rafidah Bte Ridzuan<br>**(Tampines North Primary)**|English|This sharing illustrates how authentic learning is observed in a lower primary classroom. Leveraging on the learning experiences outside the classroom and real world activities, meaningful tasks were designed to pique students’ interest in learning literacy. The outdoor learning experiences allow students to see how their learning relate to their own lives.

|CS1\_SFEd\_1|[The Joy of Learning through Arts Education](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqSX0S4r8O9GGSPluesxLX7VwChHTDp4/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Jasmine Peh Hui Wen  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Music|The joy of learning is crucial in providing a holistic education for learners in the 21st Century (Ong, 2018). In 2017, the Ministry of Education (Singapore) instilled the need to move beyond the emphasis of academic results; to nurture the joy of learning in students. This presentation will share on the motivation of conducting research studies on the 21CC and the joy of learning in Arts Education and share the key findings from two studies conducted in 2018/2019 and 2020 and the possible future research on the joy of learning in broader scope for Arts education.
|CS1\_SFEd\_2|[The use of ICT and AfL in the teaching of characterisation skills in narrative writing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zn5HxhYQBH9S-aiXXGY4IIPS1UCqXjkE/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Chew Ting Zhen  <br>Ms Wang Xiangkun  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Chinese Language<br>(Presentation in Mandarin)|This project leverages a variety of ICT tools to help teachers assess students' learning and provide timely feedback. The design of the SLS lesson involves setting tasks at different levels of DoK to maximize students' learning. Video stimuli and thinking routines are used to guide students in grasping the content knowledge. Google Sheets is then used to monitor students' learning and provide effective feedback.
|CS1\_SFEd\_3|[TraceYou](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkVyHXdgiLAT7CMebDlMCQXxamGBLXVB/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Andy Law  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Physical Education|When it comes to sports and games during PE lessons, students naturally want to play the game without thinking of improving on their skills level. Playing a game is a continuous process, hence it is always a challenge to get students to pause at different junctures of a game to reflect on their performances. When students are asked to do a reflection at the end of a game, they will tend to remember the outcome, but not the process. In this sharing, the team will explore how we can help students to reflect on the process through the use of a Heat Map, which can be an effective tool to promote active learning in PE lessons.
|CS1\_SFEd\_4|[Strategies to Improve Self-regulation and Positive Social Interaction in School – A DI Approach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNJaL-TAGszbpnZ4Z3_AtpSYYjZEb4nx/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Tan Chuan Siang Felicia  <br>**(Park View Primary School)**|General|In this segment, presenters will share how a differentiated approach is used to engage and equip special needs and at-risk students in their learning. The intent behind it is to equip students with the knowledge and skills to cope with their social and behavioral issues, as well as to prepare them to learn in the classroom environment.
