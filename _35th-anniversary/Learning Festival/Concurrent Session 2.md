| CS2\_LT\_1     | [Leveraging ICT platform in the teaching and learning of electronic circuits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e1AkD-Y29M2yJUo0YSM4S_StYaBYQOth/view?usp=sharing)     | Mr Wilfred Teo Yu Wen<br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**     |Design & Technology|This lesson focuses on the use of SLS platform, paired with web platform 'TinkerCADâ€™ to provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their learning of electronic circuits, with the aim for better visualisation of electronic circuits. Using prior knowledge to an environment (moisture) sensing circuit, students in this lesson will be using TinkerCAD to construct light sensing circuits online. Thereafter, they will make use of question tools within SLS to guide them to discover how a sensing circuit functions. Teachers will also be able to gather student inputs on SLS questions to give feedback or provide intervention so that their level of understanding can be monitored.
|CS2\_LT\_2|[Learning Poetry Through Exploratory Talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YoA9KrzHLWpVPP9z3GIfqGqSF6IyKxXs/view?usp=sharing)|Miss Filzah Binte Yahaya  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Literature in English|Is the use of the SLS platform in generating creative and spontaneous exploratory talk in the teaching of Poetry even POSSIBLE? <br>The series of lessons were aimed to allow students to explore and to make meaning when given a poem to study. Even with the introduction of MTV, students are still required to interact with each other in an organic way for a creative and imaginative response which is always the result of spontaneous exploratory talk in a traditional classroom situation. The SLS lessons seek to explore an alternative to getting exploratory talk with ICT.
|CS2\_LT\_3|[Leveraging SLS in learning of rate and ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MpWYlTUKtrRWSdR_1Us26UzdQaDfaok4/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Sumrah Bte Chuni<br>Ms Chew Shuhui Eunice<br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Lower Secondary Mathematics|In this presentation, participants will be able to see first-hand examples of how a Math SLS lesson can be designed for learners through deep and active learning. Opportunities to promote SDL and AfL will be showcased, with students' feedback and artefacts presented. Insights will also be shared on how the SLS lesson was improved using the criteria for Quality Lesson Design (QLD) as a guide, through 2 iterations of implementation
