| CS2\_LT\_1     | [Leveraging ICT platform in the teaching and learning of electronic circuits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e1AkD-Y29M2yJUo0YSM4S_StYaBYQOth/view?usp=sharing)     | Mr Wilfred Teo Yu Wen<br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**     |Design & Technology|This lesson focuses on the use of SLS platform, paired with web platform 'TinkerCAD’ to provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their learning of electronic circuits, with the aim for better visualisation of electronic circuits. Using prior knowledge to an environment (moisture) sensing circuit, students in this lesson will be using TinkerCAD to construct light sensing circuits online. Thereafter, they will make use of question tools within SLS to guide them to discover how a sensing circuit functions. Teachers will also be able to gather student inputs on SLS questions to give feedback or provide intervention so that their level of understanding can be monitored.
|CS2\_LT\_2|[Learning Poetry Through Exploratory Talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YoA9KrzHLWpVPP9z3GIfqGqSF6IyKxXs/view?usp=sharing)|Miss Filzah Binte Yahaya  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Literature in English|Is the use of the SLS platform in generating creative and spontaneous exploratory talk in the teaching of Poetry even POSSIBLE? <br>The series of lessons were aimed to allow students to explore and to make meaning when given a poem to study. Even with the introduction of MTV, students are still required to interact with each other in an organic way for a creative and imaginative response which is always the result of spontaneous exploratory talk in a traditional classroom situation. The SLS lessons seek to explore an alternative to getting exploratory talk with ICT.
|CS2\_LT\_3|[Leveraging SLS in learning of rate and ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MpWYlTUKtrRWSdR_1Us26UzdQaDfaok4/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Sumrah Bte Chuni<br>Ms Chew Shuhui Eunice<br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Lower Secondary Mathematics|In this presentation, participants will be able to see first-hand examples of how a Math SLS lesson can be designed for learners through deep and active learning. Opportunities to promote SDL and AfL will be showcased, with students' feedback and artefacts presented. Insights will also be shared on how the SLS lesson was improved using the criteria for Quality Lesson Design (QLD) as a guide, through 2 iterations of implementation
|CS2\_LT\_4|[Using Technology to engage students in the learning of Trigonometry (Angle of Elevation and Depression)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5GVNTAafZyriF5vA6WiTIjem5ot1s2G/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Ong Chih Faah  <br>Mdm Chan Wan Yin  <br>**(Tampines Secondary School)**|Mathematics|The sharing focusses on how to leverage technology to enhance T&L, in particular through purposeful design of online activities using the features in SLS so as to create a more engaging lessons for students.   <br>The lessons designed were based on  <br>-   Math performance tasks  <br>-   Assessment of learning|

|CS2\_LT\_6|[Use of interactive digital 3D models to enhance learning of biology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18wfoyLY_yW7XsK_OEntKmxxWTMbdGqhp/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Matthew Ng Kai Wen  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Biology|A significant portion of the biology syllabus and a few lower secondary science chapters involve studying parts of the human anatomy. This is typically limited to the use of static 2D models or non-interactive videos. In this presentation, we will look at the use of interactive and customizable digital 3D models to enable learners to explore various systems of the human body. This provides a more authentic learning experience, instils a sense of wonder and exploration, and promotes self-directed learning.
|CS2\_LT\_7|[Science and the 21st Century Learner](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFqXEQ0TVrDu5Q1gJj4Y29FHsxNiMf0g/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Melissa Yeong   <br>Ms Grace Lee  <br>**(Ngee Ann Secondary School)**|Science|ICT tools such as Gizmos, Google Form, Microsoft OneNote, SLS & YouTube videos are used together with guiding exploratory worksheets in the daily learning of science. This would enable teachers to gather feedback of student learning, adapt lessons accordingly as part of AfL.

|CS2\_AL\_1|[Portrait of a Drawer: From Concept to Exhibition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/156G2aZQI6iSgJztNjXpHuvNx6KZVnmXj/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Noor Rahman Bin Saini  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Art|It all starts from a question. That is how most inquiry or research begins, even in Art. Its just a matter of how deep and wide we want to delve into the topic or subject matter in question. For me, it is portraiture and how I can portray my subject's true feelings or emotions through the variety of mediums available. Join me as I share my search and art journey and how it evolved over time. It heightened during my study of the contemporary arts at UTAS (University of Tasmania) in 2012 and metamorphosised into a recent art exhibition "Senikita". #senikita2020
|CS2\_AL\_2|[Survival in the Wild 2.0: An Inquiry Approach to Teaching Lower Sec Science](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YeyjHR9WlpcI1ylweGkZtzJRTcOjMLA3/view?usp=sharing)|Ms Quah Wei Wee  <br>Ms Jaslin Jiang Wei Yeow  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Lower Secondary Science|Science is a field that requires learning through experience in tandem with explicit instructional materials. Adopting the Kolb’s experiential learning cycle of Do-Observe-Think-Plan, a learning programme on the theme of ‘Survival’ was designed to develop science process skills for our lower secondary learners. The programme provides an inquiry-based learning experience for the learners using both technology (Student Learning Space, SLS) and authentic outdoor learning spaces (EcoGarden). Through their active investigation, the learners are also engaged in independent and collaborative learning of science process skills.
|CS2\_AL\_3|[Team-based Learning (TBL) for teaching of Biology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQA1kx2HNNDtHnHwk9ck15CI_rq553kK/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Muhammad Hakim  <br>**(Ngee Ann Secondary School)**|Biology|In this segment, presenters will share on Team-based Learning (TBL). TBL is a pedagogical tool used in medical schools to facilitate self-directed and authentic learning. Kahoot quizzes are used to assess their understanding. The use of Google Slides for team presentations to solve authentic biological case studies allows proper scaffolding for students to phrase their responses.
|CS2\_AL\_4|[Food From the Heart - Decimals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/164P8EOxcc5pso29REEZaJLH89bwDcZ6_/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Shau Christopher<br>Mr Shawn Ang<br>**(Waterway Primary School)**|General Financial Literacy|Budgeting and planning is a high order thinking skill. It requires students to compare and evaluate their choices. The value of a dollar concept is something which was not covered in the text, yet hard to grasp and applicable in real-life.   <br>This lesson package aims to let students apply budgeting and planning to a real-life context. It will take the form of flipped lesson where students get to experience the planning of a donation drive and budgeting an amount for it through estimation and then verifying it by comparing between different websites. In class, students will discuss and collaborate online to budget and allocate a given monthly pocket money into fixed and variable expenses, so that they are able to meet their funding target. In this session, teachers will have the opportunity to incorporate value of empathy and experience how e-pedagogy and differentiation are used to teach financial literacy.

|CS2\_SFEd\_1|[In focus, EGGs... Inquiry-based learning (IBL) lesson using the Engage, Explore, and Apply structure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CmVYkRq6oFVrRehnNdJdQNb9at6C5wPC/view?usp=sharing)|Mdm Siti Mirna Bte Mustapah  <br>Mdm Nur Nadiah Bte Adanan  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Food & Nutrition|This is an inquiry based learning experience using EEA (Engage, Explore and Apply) methods, where students are engaged actively in exploration and experimentation during Food & Nutrition lesson. It aims to trigger students’ curiosity in a scientific phenomenon that is observed in an inquiry-based lesson for deeper understanding. By adopting Making Thinking Visible routines as a strategy,  students are encouraged to explore the versatility of eggs in their cooking and share their findings with their classmates. This will facilitate student development of an evidence-based explanation in their discussions with their classmates.
|CS2\_SFEd\_2|[Empowering the learning of Physics via manipulation of a simulated real-world environment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zgzA76ieiluuGjIslnZMQ5uOeO1duY_Z/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Jonathan Chan Aik Beng  <br>Mdm Siti Mariam Bte Hashim  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|Physics|This project puts the student in the driver's seat, allowing them to make decisions in discovering and exploring the topic of Thin Converging Lens. This was accomplished via simulations, relinquishing the locus of learning to the student, allowing self-determination of the trajectory and vector of their learning. The design intent was to cultivate a sense of curiosity and spark a joy in learning. Through this process of empowerment, it was inevitable that the instructional paths taken were diverse and decisions made, different. With this in mind, differentiated instruction was introduced into the lessons. Two SLS lesson units were designed, where students interacted with videos, simulations and laboratory apparatus to bridge the divide between the conceptual and the real world. Elements of blended learning that leveraged on social interaction helped to cater to the differences among students while the use of thinking routines and quizzes at various junctures allow formative assessments to take place.
|CS2\_SFEd\_3|[PRSS GEAR-UP Programme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ulcI0oRA9pImo79CjwVa8_GHwAUUZc8N/view?usp=sharing)|Mr Ow Kok Meng  <br>**(Pasir Ris Secondary School)**|General|When schools closed in April during the Circuit Breaker in 2020 and with home-based learning put in full swing, fault lines in the digital space and inequality among the community started to emerge in the harsh light of the pandemic. The PRSS Student Development Team would like to share how the team planned and customized the Gear Up Programme in order to provide a safe and caring environment for our High Needs Students to continue to acquire new skills, knowledge, values and social emotional competencies so as to enhance their motivation and resilience and develop a sense of connectedness to the school.
