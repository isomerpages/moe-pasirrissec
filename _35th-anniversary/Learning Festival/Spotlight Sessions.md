PRSS was a pilot school with ETD in 2019 for the implementation of PDLP.  In this spotlight session, our team will share the school’s key milestones in implementing and scaling up PDLP, the related challenges and mitigating strategies we put in place to ensure a seamless integration of technology for learning. Highlights of the sharing include the drafting of the school’s Tech Plan, ICT Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), infusing digital literacies in the curriculum and school wide routines for students (e.g. CHAMPS & STAR) to support scaling up of PDLP. Participants will also hear strategies and programmes that support professional learning with technology to develop Teachers as skillful designers and facilitators of Technology-mediated Learning Experiences.

With growing diversity in today’s classrooms, teachers are looking to instructional strategies that work best for a variety of learners. A paradigm that is gaining ground in many schools is differentiated instruction.

| **Title**     |[Assessment for Learning: Using SOLO Taxonomy to check for learning outcomes in a classroom of diverse learners.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eh1kohmyLDbjE6kbxRQtcXN90xGXqn-L/view?usp=sharing) |

|School|Pasir Ris Secondary School
|Synopsis|

Hattie and Donoghue (2016) suggests that one of the most important success factors in learning is students' understanding of what it means to be successful before undertaking the task. Hence, having transparent assessment grading criteria would better support students to be successful in their learning. The SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can help determine different levels of student performance.

The team will show how SOLO or Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes can be adopted to design a lesson and to check for learning outcomes in a classroom of diverse learners. When framed within clear Learning Intentions and Success Criteria, these levels of outcome provides effective feedback to help teachers and students feed forward or close gaps in their learning. SOLO also sits nicely in the STP Assessment & Feedback in the Teaching Action of ‘I Do, I Know or I Check’ meant to bring about enhanced collaboration, reflection and monitoring.
