|Synopsis|

PRSS was a pilot school with ETD in 2019 for the implementation of PDLP.  In this spotlight session, our team will share the school’s key milestones in implementing and scaling up PDLP, the related challenges and mitigating strategies we put in place to ensure a seamless integration of technology for learning. Highlights of the sharing include the drafting of the school’s Tech Plan, ICT Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), infusing digital literacies in the curriculum and school wide routines for students (e.g. CHAMPS & STAR) to support scaling up of PDLP. Participants will also hear strategies and programmes that support professional learning with technology to develop Teachers as skillful designers and facilitators of Technology-mediated Learning Experiences.
