With pride and joy let us sing  
Let truth and sincerity come right from your heart  
These and other thoughts we gladly bring  
To Pasir Ris right from the start  

There's care and service we offer  
Give kindness to everyone and grudging to none  
These and other deeds to you we proffer  
Realizing the best from everyone  
  
Have pride in self and concern for others  
But never from the good to stray away  
  
With pride and joy let us sing  
Let truth and sincerity come right from your heart  
These and other thoughts we gladly bring  
To Pasir Ris right from the start  
To Pasir Ris right from the start
