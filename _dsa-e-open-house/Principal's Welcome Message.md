Dear Parents &amp; Prospective Students

Thank you for your interest in Pasir Ris Secondary School (PRSS).

PRSS is the first secondary school to be set up in Tampines in 1985.&nbsp; We have worked on many exciting initiatives and reviewed our curriculum to stay relevant and responsive to the evolving landscape.&nbsp; Many cohorts of students have benefited from our emphasis on a holistic education and have done well in articulating to post-secondary institutions.

We believe that every child can learn and succeed under the guidance and support of teachers in partnership with parents.&nbsp; Our mission of “Inspiring Lives, Nurturing Talents, Realising Dreams” is manifested in the many programmes designed to cater to the diverse interests and needs of students. Our teachers are involved in professional learning teams, critical inquiry and research to inform practice.&nbsp; As a pilot school for PDLP in 2019 where Sec 1 students were equipped with personal Chromebooks, Blended learning has become a regular feature in the time-table where students can log into lessons from home and pursue self-initiated learning at their own pace fortnightly. We continue to review our EdTech Masterplan to incorporate the latest affordances of EdTech for teaching and learning such as leveraging AI and working in partnership with ETD to grow digital literacies and 21st Century competencies. Our vision is to become a future-ready school with a vibrant community of confident and discerning learners who can harness technology skilfully to navigate the complexities of a technology-transformed world.

This year, we celebrate our 40th anniversary with a focus on empowering students to contribute to the community.&nbsp; Our theme on Kindness: Small Acts, Big Impact has generated much interest and awareness in the school community with students contributing 40 stories on acts of kindness to mark our school’s 40th birthday.

The school’s LLP in Music and the performing arts have grown many talents in a wide range of genres and skillsets.&nbsp; Students had the opportunity to participate in the NDP Virtual Choir 2024, SYF and various public performances and competitions.&nbsp;

A holistic and balanced education is what we advocate at PRSS.&nbsp; Students can choose from a range of CCAs from Sports, Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts and Clubs. Fostering the joy of learning and preparing our students well for the future with the requisite skills, knowledge, values, dispositions and competencies,&nbsp; is aligned with our vision of growing ‘Confident Learners, Caring and Resilient Citizens’.&nbsp;

Thank You and Best Wishes to our P6s
