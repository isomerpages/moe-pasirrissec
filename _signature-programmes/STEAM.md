##### Going full S.T.E.A.M. ahead

_“Our children must be equipped with **diverse skill sets that open doors** for them in the modern economy. In a world driven by new technologies and science, we will need to strengthen STEM learning in our schools,” explains Education Minister Chan Chun Sing._

To help students keep up with the Information Age, it is necessary to expose them to S.T.E.A.M. – which stands for **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **A**rts and **M**athematics. One of the main advantages of S.T.E.A.M. education is the introduction of soft skills such as creativity, collaboration, and communication. The inclusion of ‘Arts’ in the STEM curriculum offers a holistic interdisciplinary approach that encourages students to think more critically and creatively about the world around them.

In PRSS, the infusion of the S.T.E.A.M. curriculum in our daily lessons helps raise students’ awareness of an interdisciplinary approach to learning via S.T.E.A.M. In addition, our inaugural S.T.E.A.M Festival for all students provides hands-on opportunities for authentic learning with the application of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. We hope to nurture a lifelong interest in S.T.E.A.M and its application so that more of them join the science and technology sector.
