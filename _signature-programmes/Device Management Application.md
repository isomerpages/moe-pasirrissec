#### Purpose of DMA 

1. The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 **to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital skills** to be future-ready. 
2. Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will **own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD)** which will be installed with Device Management Application (DMA).
3. The Device Management Application (DMA) software **will be installed on all students’ PLDs to provide a safe learning experience for students**, and to prevent misuse of the device.

#### Providing Parents/Guardians Choice for After-School PLD Use
