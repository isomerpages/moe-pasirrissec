Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Music and Performing Arts is a broad-based programme encapsulated in ‘SHINE’ which comprises 5 key areas:  Self-discovery of Interest and Ability, Heritage & Cultural Appreciation, Interaction & Collaborative learning, eNgagement in Community Outreach & Partnership and Excellence in Artistic Expression. Through Music and the Performing Arts, we hope to cultivate sound values, build character and help our students to pursue their passion and talent in aesthetics.
