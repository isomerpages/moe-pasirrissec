## Music and Performing Arts

In Pasir Ris Secondary School, we embrace the love of aesthetics and strive towards building a vibrant culture in the **Music and Performing Arts**. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Music and Performing Arts is a broad-based programme where we aim to create the environment where every child can **SHINE through the ARTs**.

We **SH**ape, **IN**tegrate and **E**xpress through these 5 key strategies:

1. **Self-discovery of interest and ability (S)**<br>
Provide structured and integrated programmes for students to develop self-awareness and self-management through discovery and pursuit of their artistic interests.

2. **Heritage and Cultural appreciation (H)**<br>
Heighten studentsâ€™ cultural awareness, respect for diversity and appreciation of the uniqueness of the various cultures through exposure to the music and drama programmes of the different cultural groups.

3. **Interaction and Collaborative Learning (I)**<br>
Provide opportunities for students to work in teams on their projects within the school or with external organisations and institutions (locally or overseas) to develop their interpersonal and collaboration
skills.

4. **Engagement in Community Outreach and Partnership (N)**<br>
Provide platforms for students to contribute to the community by putting up performances to entertain, educate and foster closer relationships as part of their Values-In-Action projects.

5. **Excellence in Artistic Expressions (E)**<br>
