third_nav_title: Overseas Twinning Programme
---
PRSS has been established e-twinning with two Japanese schools over the last two years with the objectives of: 

a.	Deepening in our students the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) of global and cross-cultural literacy and sensitivities. 

b.	Exposing students to Asia with a greater focus on ASEAN countries, China and India, and sensitize them to Singapore and its place in the world; and 

c.	Strengthen studentsâ€™ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.
In 2023, PRSS established partnership with Chitose Junior High School. As it was our first year doing the exchange only selected students from each Sec 1 class were involved. 


In 2024, PRSS connected with Kojimachi Junior High School. We scaled up on the number of students participating in this overseas exchange to allow all Sec 1 students to be able to participate and benefit from it. In preparation for the session, the Sec 1 students created presentations to share with their Japanese friends about the education system in Singapore from their CCAs to what they do daily as a student in Singapore. They also shared about their hobbies, as well as attractions in Singapore and invited their Japanese friends to visit Singapore.
