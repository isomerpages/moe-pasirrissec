Pasir Ris Secondary School embarks on the 5D4N Nanjing School Immersion and Twinning Programme with schools in China so as to achieve the following:

  

*   To deepen in Pasirians the emerging 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities;
*   To sensitize Pasirians to the place of Singapore in the emerging economic, educational and technological landscapes in the world, by exposing them to Nanjing and Jin Ling High School (Xianlin campus);
*   To strengthen Pasirians’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

This is our inaugural immersion and twinning programme with a high school in Nanjing.

  

**Highlights**

*   School attachment programme in the twinning school
