Pasir Ris Secondary School embarks on twinning programme with schools in China so as to achieve the following:

 *   Deepen in Pasirians the emerging 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities
 *   Sensitise Pasirians to Singapore’s role and place in the emerging economic, educational and technological landscapes around the world through exposing them to schools and cities in Asia and ASEAN
 *   Strengthen Pasirians’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

A key part of the programme is an annual overseas immersion trip to schools in countries in Asia and the ASEAN, such as China and Brunei. Pasirians will in turn host their counterparts when they visit Singapore.

**Highlights**

*   School immersion programme
*   Industry visits
*   Cultural site visits
