The school has organised an overseas cultural and school immersion trip to Penang in 2023 and 2024. The objectives of the immersion trip are as follows:
o	To deepen in Pasirians the emerging 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities
o	To sensitize Pasirians to the place of Singapore in the emerging economic, educational and technological landscapes in the world, through exposing them to an ASEAN school and city.
o	To continue to learn and collaborate with SMK Convent Butterworth in eco-stewardship and fostering cross-cultural understanding and friendship among students from both schools.

The highlights of the trip include interaction and exchange of ideas and experiences on eco-school practices with staff and students from Penangâ€™s SMK Convent Butterworth and an industry visit to Paramit Malaysia which is a global contract development and manufacturing firm, known as Factory in a Forest for their sustainable efforts in architectural design and factory operations. Our teachers and students also visited the iconic Penang Hill, Peranakan Museum, Chew Jetty and Armenian Street which featured various forms of street art and Chinese clan houses.  Through this trip, students fostered their knowledge of sustainability and strengthened their appreciation and sense of belonging to Singapore.
