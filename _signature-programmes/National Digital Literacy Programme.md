<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<p>In 2019, our Secondary 1 cohort participated in the 1:1 Learning Pilot
Project with the Ministry of Education (MOE). This provided an opportunity
for Teachers to work closely with MOE Officers to customise, differentiate
and personalise learning experiences where our students learn in a 1:1
computing environment.</p>
<p>By integrating technology and digital learning into school-wide curriculum,
pedagogy and assessment, teachers were able to design and bring about student-centric
and active learning experiences.</p>

<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the<strong> Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</strong> for
all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will
own a school-prescribed computing device or Personal Learning Device (PLD)
by end-2021.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national
e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well
as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.
This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply
these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students
will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of <strong>MOE Digital Literacy Framework</strong>:</p>

<h4><strong>Personal Learning Device</strong></h4>
<p>At Pasir Ris Secondary School, all students use a Chromebook as their
PLD. Chromebooks are chosen for their variety of affordances, including
seamless learning experiences alongside existing teaching and learning
technologies such as the SLS, Google Suite for Education Apps and Microsoft
Pro Plus.</p>
<p>It is also a relatively lightweight and portable device that offers students
convenient learning on-the-move. A full charge of the battery typically
allows students to work on their PLDs for the entire curriculum hours.</p>

<p>Since 2021, every Secondary 1 student purchase their own Chromebook<strong> </strong>as
the school-prescribed PLD. This device is a touchscreen convertible laptop
(i.e. can be used as a laptop or rotated 180 into a tablet) and comes with
its own in-built stylus for inking functions.</p>

<h4><strong>Financial Assistance</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure affordability of the PLD, there was a one-time Edusave top-up
of $200 in every student’s Edusave account in April 2020. Additional subsidies
are available for students that are on financial assistance schemes.</p>
<p>Students, including permanent residents (PR) and international students
(IS), that need additional support should approach the General Office for
more information on financial assistance.</p>
