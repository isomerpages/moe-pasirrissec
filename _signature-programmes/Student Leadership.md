#### **Student Leadership Development Programme**  
<br>

&gt; "A Leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way." - John C Maxwell. 

The school's Student Leadership Development Programme, also known as the **Pegasus Programme**, is undergirded by our belief that **Every Pasirian can be a Confident, Caring and Resilient Leader**. 

With a structured and comprehensive four-years programme that provides leadership development opportunities for all students to develop their leadership potential, we seek to equip students with the the necessary knowledge, skills, dispositions and values for them to achieve the following desired outcomes: 
* Communicate and collaborate with others effectively
* Adaptable and resilient to problem-solve in challenging, complex and ambiguous situations
* Cognisant of social contexts and able to contribute constructively to the school and community The Pegasus Programme adopts a 4-tier structure, guided by a progressive 4Es approach (Experience, Engage, Empower, Encourage) to cater to
*     students’ readiness and aspirations.
