### **Student Leadership Development Programme**  

The school provides leadership development opportunities to all students and also identifies and develops the leadership potential in our students. The school’s PRIZE values shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of a Pasirian student leader.

With a structured and comprehensive four-year student leadership development programme named **Pegasus Programme**, students will acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and values for them to serve the school, lead their school mates and excel in their pursuits in life. This is in line with our school’s vision to develop students to become **Confident learners, Caring &amp; Resilient Citizens**; who have moral courage, communicate effectively, inspire others and take initiative to make a difference.

Students learn to lead through observing exemplary **role models** in and outside school. Their leadership competencies are developed with the numerous **training** opportunities provided by the school. They further enhance their own leadership skills during the many learning **experiences** and platforms to apply their leadership skills.

The Pegasus Programme aims to develop the 8 skills that each student will need to become an exemplary and effective leader. The eight skills are as follows:

1.  Decision-making Skills (Critical Thinking and problem-solving skills)
2.  Collaborative Skills (Collaboration across networks)&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.  Influencing Skills (Leading by influence)
4.  Empathy Skills (Agility and Adaptability)
5.  Communication Skills (Effective oral and written communication)
6.  Analytical Skills (Accessing and analysing information)
7.  Organisational Skills (Initiative and Entrepreneurship)
8.  Curiosity and Imagination (Innovativeness)

Students’ leadership knowledge, skills and values are developed through a continuum of workshops, lectures, seminars, camps and external leadership programmes. Student leaders then transfer their learning into authentic practices by conducting workshops, facilitating camps and organising school and community events.

The programme is tiered and progressive. The different levels of development follow a different theme to cater to the students’ readiness and aspiration

The student leadership development approach adopted is aligned with The Leadership Challenge model developed by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner from Santa Clara University. Students will develop their competencies in line with the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership espoused by this model, namely 1) Model The Way, 2) Enable Others to Act, 3) Challenge The Process, 4) Inspire A Shared Vision and 5) Encourage The Heart.

The student leaders in PRSS comprise the Student Councillors, Class Leaders Committees and CCA Leaders. These student leaders are identified and selected based on the following four criteria.

1.  Leadership potential
    
2.  Keen and willing to serve the school and community
    
3.  Good academic performance
    
4.  Good discipline record
      
Nominations are made by teachers, peers and aspiring student leaders themselves. However, an appointment will be based on the students’ continued good performance and positive assessment by school leaders, teachers and peers.
