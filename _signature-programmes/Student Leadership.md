#### **Student Leadership Development Programme**  

##### A Leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.  - John C Maxwell 

The school's Student Leadership Development Programme, also known as the **Pegasus Programme**, is undergirded by our belief that **Every Pasirian can be a Confident, Caring and Resilient Leader**. 

With a structured and comprehensive four-years programme that provides leadership development opportunities for all students to develop their leadership potential, we seek to equip students with the the necessary knowledge, skills, dispositions and values for them to achieve the following desired outcomes: 
* Communicate and collaborate with others effectively
* Adaptable and resilient to problem-solve in challenging, complex and ambiguous situations
* Cognisant of social contexts and able to contribute constructively to the school and community 

The Pegasus Programme adopts a 4-tier structure, guided by a progressive 4Es approach (Experience, Engage, Empower, Encourage) to cater to students’ readiness and aspirations.

Our student leadership development approach is aligned with The Leadership Challenge Model developed by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner. Students will develop their competencies in line with the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership espoused by this model, namely 1) Model The Way, 2) Enable Others to Act, 3) Challenge The Process, 4) Inspire A Shared Vision and 5) Encourage The Heart.

Students’ leadership knowledge, skills, dispositions and values are developed through a continuum of training opportunities, such as workshops, lectures, seminars, camps and external leadership programmes. Student Leaders then transfer their learning into authentic practices through various empowering platforms as they serve the school, lead their peers and excel in their pursuits in life. 

PRSS Student Leader Group comprises the Student Councillors, Class Leaders Committees, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Leaders. These Student Leaders are identified and selected based on the following four criteria: - Leadership potential - Willingness to serve the school and community - Good academic performance - Good discipline record 

Nominations are made by teachers, peers and aspiring student leaders themselves. The eventual appointment will be based on students’ continued good performance and positive assessment by school leaders, teachers and peers.
