#### Sec 1 - Camp Oneiric


Transitioning to a secondary school can be both exciting but daunting for all Secondary One students. To welcome the Secondary Ones to the Pasirians' Family, we design enriching and fun activities for them through  "Camp Oneiric" in the first week of school. 

  

In Camp Oneiric, we are sure that the Secondary Ones will enjoy and have a memorable time in the series of fun and exciting activities that we have lined up for them. We believe that the camp will provide solid transitional support for the Secondary One students. 

  

Camp Oneiric offers plenty of opportunities for our students to step beyond their comfort zones and become independent and confident learners. Some of the highlights from this camp include making the dream catcher, Kin Ball, Amazing Race, Aesthetic Induction program, and music-making sessions. These activities will establish stronger bonds between classmates and their teachers.

#### Sec 2 - Camp Spark


At Camp Spark, students will discover their interests and strengths and develop their socio-emotional competencies through venturing out of their comfort zone and working with others. 

  

The theme of Camp Spark and its tagline “Zest For Life” is specially conceptualised with the aim to ignite the zeal and drive in Pasirians, which is the key to enable Pasirians to work towards realising their dreams. It takes a spark to get the fire burning. This is akin to the Pasirians starting to discover (spark off) their interests, strengths and acquiring a positive mindset. 

The metaphor of “Campfire” symbolizes the progression whereby Pasirians have gained their footing after Secondary One, internalised the PRIZE values and way of life, and will now begin their preparation to cultivate passion to chase their dreams.

  

Through the camp, students will develop a positive mindset as they learn to overcome challenges they face along the way. Through the authentic and experiential learning in this camp, they will forge friendships, deepen their sense of belonging, and pride towards the school. Highlights of this year’s camp include virtual reality, urban farming, outdoor cooking, laser tag and class-based campfires!
