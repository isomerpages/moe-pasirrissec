Pasir Ris Secondary School’s Signature Programmes are designed and customised for all Pasirians - with the intention to imbue in them a love for learning, as well as to provide multiple platforms for the application of our PRIZE values. 

In addition to our Learning for Life Programme in Music and Performing Arts, our school has been a pilot for the 1:1 Personal Digital Learning Programme since 2019, in support of the National Digital Literacy Programme. 

Through initiatives such as Interdisciplinary Project Work, Level Camps, the Overseas Twinning Programme, and our student leadership development initiative – the Pegasus Programme – we strive to nurture Pasirians into confident learners, and caring, resilient citizens.
