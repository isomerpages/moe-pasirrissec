Pasir Ris Secondary Schoolâ€™s Signature Programmes are designed and customised for all Pasirians - with the intention to imbue in them a love for learning, as well as to provide multiple platforms for the application of our PRIZE values. Besides our Applied Learning Programme: Eye on the World - Stories through Journalism, and the Learning for Life Programme in Music and Performing Arts, in alignment with the national imperative to mount the National Digital Literacy Programme, our school has been one of the pilot schools for the 1:1 Personal Digital Learning Programme since 2019. In addition, through Interdisciplinary Project Work, Level Camps, Overseas Twinning Programme, as well as our Student Leadership Development Programme - the Pegasus Programme, we seek to nurture Pasirians to become Confident Learners, Caring and Resilient Citizens.
