#### Background

In 2019, our Secondary 1 cohort participated in the 1:1 Learning Pilot Project with the Ministry of Education (MOE). This provided an opportunity for Teachers to work closely with MOE Officers to customise, differentiate and personalise learning experiences where our students learn in a 1:1 computing environment. By integrating technology and digital learning into school-wide curriculum, pedagogy and assessment, teachers were able to design and bring about student-centric and active learning experiences.
