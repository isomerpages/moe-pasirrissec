#### Background

In 2019, our Secondary 1 cohort participated in the 1:1 Learning Pilot Project with the Ministry of Education (MOE). This provided an opportunity for Teachers to work closely with MOE Officers to customise, differentiate and personalise learning experiences where our students learn in a 1:1 computing environment. By integrating technology and digital learning into school-wide curriculum, pedagogy and assessment, teachers were able to design and bring about student-centric and active learning experiences.

One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed computing device or Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.    

The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework:
