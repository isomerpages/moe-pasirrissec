<h4>Background</h4>
<p>In 2019, our Secondary 1 cohort participated in the 1:1 Learning Pilot
Project with the Ministry of Education (MOE). This provided an opportunity
for Teachers to work closely with MOE Officers to customise, differentiate
and personalise learning experiences where our students learn in a 1:1
computing environment.</p>
<p>By integrating technology and digital learning into school-wide curriculum,
pedagogy and assessment, teachers were able to design and bring about student-centric
and active learning experiences.</p>

<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the <strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong> for
our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen
their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction
of the <strong>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</strong> for
all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will
own a school-prescribed computing device or Personal Learning Device (PLD)
by end-2021.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national
e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well
as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.
This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply
these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students
will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of <strong>MOE Digital Literacy Framework</strong>:</p>

<h4>Personal Learning Device (PLD)</h4>
<p>At PRSS, all students use a <strong>Chromebook</strong> as their PLD. Chromebooks
are chosen for their variety of affordances, including seamless learning
experiences alongside existing teaching and learning technologies such
as the SLS, Google Suite for Education Apps and Microsoft Pro Plus.</p>
<p>It is also a relatively lightweight and portable device that offers students
convenient learning on-the-move. A full charge of the battery typically
allows students to work on their PLDs for the entire curriculum hours.</p>

<p>Since 2021, every Secondary 1 student purchase their own <strong>Chromebook</strong> as
the school-prescribed PLD. This device is a touchscreen convertible laptop
(i.e. can be used as a laptop or rotated 180 into a tablet) and comes with
its own in-built stylus for inking functions.</p>

<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>
<p>To ensure affordability of the PLD, there was a one-time Edusave top-up
of $200 in every student’s Edusave account in April 2020. Additional subsidies
are available for students that are on financial assistance schemes.</p>
<p>Students, including permanent residents (PR) and international students
(IS), that need additional support should approach the General Office for
more information on financial assistance.</p>
