#### Eye on the World – Stories through Journalism


The Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Eye on the World – Stories through Journalism, aims to provide students with opportunities to relate learning to real-life situations; increase their awareness of local and global issues; and develop critical thinking and effective communication skills through various journalism platforms.

  

The programme was first started in 2015, with a focus on deepening interest and applying learning in Humanities and English language in various real life situations. Students do this through various integrated projects in the IP and non-IP areas such as IPW and VIA. These programmes brought them out to the real world and develop their confidence in engaging with other stakeholders in the community. Concurrently, a Current Affairs programme was developed to help our students develop an interest and learn more about contemporary issues which affect them and the community. 

  

A strategic review was carried out in 2018 and the programme was further enhanced with the addition of journalism platforms as avenues where our students can apply their learning and express themselves. These platforms include radio shows, podcast and video productions. In addition, an accompanying industry exposure programme was developed to expose our students to jobs and career opportunities in these areas.
