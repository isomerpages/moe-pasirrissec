The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

  

##### **Eligibility**
LOA applies to all SC and PR children in primary school, secondary school, junior colleges and Millennia Institute.  

To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all 3 of the following criteria:

* An SC or PR.
* Presently studying in a Singapore school.
* Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining their school after returning to Singapore.

More details on the LOA scheme can be found on the MOE website [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans).
