The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

##### Eligibility

LOA applies to all Singapore Citizens (SC) and Permanent Resident (PR) children in primary school, secondary school, junior colleges and Millennia Institute.  

To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all three of the following criteria:

* An SC or PR.
* Presently studying in a Singapore school.
* Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining their school after returning to Singapore.

More details on the LOA scheme can be found on MOE [Overview of school admissions for Returning Singaporeans](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans) website.
