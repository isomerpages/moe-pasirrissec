Dear parents,

Is your child clear about his/her interests, abilities and passion? Is he/she about to make an important decision regarding his/her education and career pathways?

At the Budget Debate 2016, MOE highlighted the importance of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and that greater support would be given to help our children make better-informed education and career choices through the provision of ECG counselors and increased opportunities to raise our children’s awareness of specific industries. We recognise that for our children to thrive in a globalised economy and navigate meaningfully through life, they would benefit from having sound values and learning to seize every opportunity to develop transferable soft skills such as cross-cultural communication skills, problem-solving skills, and team work; and continually developing workplace readiness skills such as literacy, numeracy, and technical skills throughout life.

Beyond schools’ efforts, parents can also play an important role at home in guiding our children in making important decisions for their education and career pathways. Some tips on how to help and guide your child are included in this e-mailer. Take the opportunity to discuss with your child the education and career options given the diverse and flexible pathways available at every key education stage.

##### **Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) Counselling**

Our&nbsp;ECG&nbsp;Counsellor, Mr Syahril, supports students (individually or in small groups) with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed decisions for a smoother transition to further education or work.

Students who would like to&nbsp;explore their subject choices, ask about post-secondary education options, or find out more about&nbsp;their career interests, strengths and passions can make an appointment to have a chat with him.

<br>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives.

  

<br>The ECG curriculum aims to:

*   Nurture students’ self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning and training;
*   Enable students to explore viable education and career options through the provision of accurate and comprehensive information;
*   Inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well-functioning of society; and
*   Equip our students with skills and means to positively engage their parents and other career influencers.
