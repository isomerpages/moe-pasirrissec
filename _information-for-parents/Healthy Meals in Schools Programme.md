Childhood and adolescent years are crucial to set the foundation for healthy growth. Eating a nutritionally balanced diet supports optimal growth and development. By encouraging healthy eating habits now, we can give our students the best opportunity to grow into healthy adults.

Health Promotion Board (HPB) has developed a Parents’ Booklet to encourage parents to nurture healthy eating habits at home. Together with the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme, we aim to promote the consumption of healthy meals with a balanced mix of the four different food groups – brown rice, whole grain noodles and wholemeal bread; fruit and vegetables as well as meat and alternatives, both in school and at home.

Please view the e-version of [Parents' Booklet](/files/HPB%20HM%20Parents%20Booklet_School_Generic_30%20Mar.pdf). You can learn more on the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme in [Health Promotion Board](https://hpb.gov.sg/schools/school-programmes/healthy-meals-in-schools-programme) website.
