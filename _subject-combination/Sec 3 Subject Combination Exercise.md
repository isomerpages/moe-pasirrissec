### Overview

Sec 3 Subject Combination Exercise provides students with the opportunity to choose a subject combination they would like to pursue at the Upper Secondary levels (in addition to the compulsory subjects they are required to take), based on academic merit and interest in subjects offered.

This facilitates a deeper study in preferred subjects, preparing students for post-secondary education in JCs, Polytechnics, and ITEs. Hence, students should make their choices based on their aptitude, interest, career considerations, learning styles and dispositions.

The exercise will take place after the End-of-Year examinations, and the allocation of combinations is based on academic merit as demonstrated in the overall academic performance at Sec 2 and teacher recommendations.

All subject combinations offered are carefully curated to help pave the way for students to pursue post-secondary courses at the various tertiary educational institutions.
