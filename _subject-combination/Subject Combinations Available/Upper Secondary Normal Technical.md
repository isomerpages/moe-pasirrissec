<p>Art inspires self-confidence in students, helping them develop critical,
imaginative and creative thinking and process skills for both life and
work. The study of Art helps provide a foundation for understanding and
evaluating aesthetic intention and artistic skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will be able to exercise their cognitive reasoning and their
intuition. Studentsâ€™ cognitive skills, such as language fluency, are enhanced
when they talk and write about the works of art they have encountered or
created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The production of Art requires a rigorous process of information analysis.
In interpreting Art, students need to synthesise perception, information
about the artwork and their own experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, students will be exposed to a diverse range of local, regional
and global art and cultures through engaging with artworks, art making
and arts professions. This will develop in students a lifelong appreciation
and enjoyment of art.</p>
