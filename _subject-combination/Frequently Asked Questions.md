<label for="accordion4"><b>Q4: Under what circumstances will my child/ward not get the subject combination of his/her choice?</b></label>	
<p>
Other than not meeting the pre-requisite criteria for subject/s within the subject combination of his/her choice, your child/ward may not get the subject combination of his/her choice due to the following reasons:<br>
<br>
(i) Insufficient student interest in a subject to start a class (ie. <b>minimum class size of 8 students)</b><br><br>
(ii) Lack of resources to fully meet the demands of the subject (for example, lack of teachers)<br><br>
(iii) The maximum enrolment capacity is met for elective subjects using special facilities i.e. Art, Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T).

<p>No, polytechnic admission only requires English language (or another L1 e.g. Higher Mother Tongue), 2 relevant subjects and 2 other best subjects. For engineering courses, the relevant subjects must include the Mathematics and Science subjects, depending on the choice of study. The Mathematics subject could be either Elementary Mathematics or Additional Mathematics, whichever has a better grade. The same criteria apply for JC. Additional Mathematics is recommended if the student wants to pursue Science Stream in JC.&nbsp; For the latest admission requirements, do refer to the respective tertiary institution websites.</p>
