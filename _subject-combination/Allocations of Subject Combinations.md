#### **Guiding Principles for allocation of Subject Combinations**

**1.  Evidence of demonstrated aptitude and ability**
    
	a. Secondary 2 Overall Results (NA/Exp) – EMSHB2

			EL + Maths + Sci+ 1 Hum (Hist/Geog/Lit) + B2 (2  other best subjects from Art/DT/FCE/MTL/HMTL)

	b. Secondary 2 Overall Subject Results - e.g. 65% overall in History for Pure History
  
**2.  Student’s Preference**
    
Students should choose subject combinations based on their aptitude, interest and post-secondary aspirations and submit their choices during the Subject Combination Exercise in October.

**3.  Availability of Resources**

Subject combinations offered are subjected to availability of vacancies in each subject and school resources.
