Dear Parents & Prospective Students 

Thank you for your interest in Pasir Ris Secondary School (PRSS).

PRSS is the first secondary school to be set up in Tampines in 1985.  Over the past 36 years, we have worked on many exciting initiatives and reviewed our curriculum to stay relevant and responsive to the evolving landscape.  Many cohorts of students have benefited from our emphasis on a holistic education and have done well in articulating to post-secondary institutions.

 We believe that every child can learn and succeed with under the guidance and support of teachers in partnership with parents.  Our mission of “Inspiring Lives, Nurturing Talents, Realising Dreams” is manifested in the many programmes designed to cater to the diverse interests and needs of students. 

Our teachers are involved in professional learning teams, critical inquiry and research to inform practice.  As a pilot school for PDLP in 2019 where Sec 1 students were equipped with personal Chromebooks, we were able to transit smoothly to HBL and Blended learning during the pandemic.   The fortnightly blended learning has become a regular feature in the time-table where students can log into lessons from home and pursue self-initiated learning at their own pace.  PRSS continues to explore the affordances of technology to design quality programmes for our students.  Some new initiatives in recent years include Makerspace, urban farming, interdisciplinary work such as STEAM,  Poetry Under the Stars, computational thinking and explorations on AI(Artificial Intelligence) such as the use of language checkers for English Language and  CoTF (Classroom of The Future) projects.

 The school’s 2 distinctive programmes namely **LLP in Music and the performing arts and ALP in Journalism (eg broadcast journalism and photo journalism)** have grown many talents in a wide range of genres and skillsets.

 A holistic and balanced education is what we advocate at PRSS.  Students can choose from a range of CCAs from Sports, Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts and Clubs. Fostering the joy of learning and preparing our students well for the future with the requisite skills, knowledge, values and attitudes is aligned with our vision of ‘Confident Learners, Caring and Resilient Citizens’.
