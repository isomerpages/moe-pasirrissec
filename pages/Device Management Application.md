<h4><strong>Device Management Application Installation</strong></h4>
<p>Your child’s/ward’s PLD will be installed with a DMA to provide a safer
digital environment for learning. DMA will be installed after the collection
of the device. Students will be guided on the installation.</p>
<p>The installation of DMA applies to both devices purchased through the
school and any student-owned devices that parents/guardians opt for the
student to use in lieu of the school-prescribed PLD.</p>
<p>The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device
when your child/ward graduates/leaves the school.</p>
<h4><strong>Providing Parents/Guardians with Greater Choice of After-School DMA Parent Options</strong></h4>
<p>The following infographic outline the different levels of restrictions,
controls, and monitoring for the different DMA options after school hours.</p>

the same form. The request will be processed by the school monthly.</p>
<h4><strong>DMA Resources for parent who have onboard the After-School Parent Options</strong></h4>

will receive an e-mail invitation to onboard the Mobile Guardian via the
e-mail address that they have provided to the school.</p>
<p>If the activation e-mail is not found in their Inbox, please check the
‘Junk Folder’ or ‘Spam Folder’ for the e-mail notification. Parents/Guardians

<h4><strong>Uninstallation of DMA for Graduating Students</strong></h4>
<p>DMA will be uninstalled from your child’s/ward’s PLD once he/she is graduating
from the school. DMA will be uninstalled ONLY for students who are not
continuing the 5NA course.</p>
<p>After the DMA has been uninstalled, your child/ward will be able to use
the PLD without the DMA. Your child’s/ward’s browsing activity will no
longer be monitored and the browsing history on his/her PLD will also be
deleted from the DMA system server.</p>
<p><strong>Actions required by your child/ward:</strong>
