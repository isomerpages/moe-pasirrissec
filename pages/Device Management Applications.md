#### Device Management Application Installation

Your child’s/ward’s PLD will be installed with a DMA to provide a safer digital environment for learning.  DMA will be installed after the collection of the device. Students will be guided on the installation.

The installation of DMA applies to both devices purchased through the school and any student-owned devices that parents/guardians opt for the student to use in lieu of the school-prescribed PLD.

The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device when your child/ward graduates/leaves the school.
