#### DMA Parents Options

Your child’s/ward’s PLD will be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) to provide a safer digital environment for learning.

Installation of the DMA will be performed after the collection of the device. Students will be guided on the installation. This applies to both devices purchased through the school and pre-existing student-owned devices.

The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device when your child/ward graduates and or leave the school.

#### School DMA Settings (Default)

Schools will determine DMA settings for school use. As a default, these settings will continue to be in place after school as well:

* MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including filtering out objectionable content or content that may not be conducive to teaching and learning (e.g. social media, pornography, gambling, or websites containing extremist content)
* Students will be able to use the device from 06.00 a.m. to 11 p.m daily. 
*  The school will determine the apps and programs to be installed to support teaching and learning

| Default | Option A | Option B |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| In-school DMA settings will continue after school hours  | Parents/Guardians can modify the DMA settings after school hours  | Parents/Guardians can choose to disable DMA after school hours   |
| For parents/guardians who want their child’s/ward’s use of the devices to be restricted only to teaching and learning, and prefer to leave it to the school to decide on DMA settings after school hours. | For parents/guardians who want more leeway over the use of the device, and prefer to take charge of the level of restrictions for their child’s/ward’s use of the device after school hours.| For parents/guardians who do not want their child’s/ward’s use of the device to be regulated by DMA after school. |
