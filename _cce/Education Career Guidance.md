“What do you want to be when you grow up?”

  

Choosing one's education or career path is one of the most important yet difficult decisions to make. Students need to be able to make well-informed choices by talking to their parents, home teachers, subject teachers and/or school ECG counsellor about their education and career aspirations. They can also explore and gather information via the MOE Education and Career Guidance e-portal at https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/secondary
