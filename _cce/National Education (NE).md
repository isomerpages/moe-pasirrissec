#### FUTURE-ORIENTED CITIZENSHIP

National Education is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions which enable Pasirians to realise their part in the success of the community and nation:  

*   A sense of belonging: With the changing social fabric and continually evolving national identity, students need to develop a deeper awareness of who they are as Singaporeans and a nation, as well as a shared understanding of the “common good” for all as a nation. 
*   A sense of reality: It is important for students to be aware of and understand Singapore’s constraints, vulnerabilities and the contemporary realities that confront us as a country amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world. 
*   A sense of hope: It is critical for our citizenry to continue to have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future, and resilience to face the challenges ahead.

**Programmes to Develop Citizenship Dispositions in Pasirians**

In order to create holistic learning experiences among Pasirians, a plethora of events and activities are organised throughout the years. These activities include commemoration of Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, National Day and NRIC Presentation Ceremony. With these programmes, we hope that Pasirians’ understanding of their identity and convictions as citizens will be developed as they lead and participate actively.

As for our international students, rich programmes such as visit to Supreme Court and musicals based on historical figures are also organised in order to help them better integrate and understand Singapore’s history and heritage.

**Integration Programme  **

The Integration Programme is catered to our international students, as well as students who are Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs).

The programme aims to increase awareness of the importance of integration and help newcomers adapt to the Singaporean way of life by facilitating the formation of friendships and shared experiences among local and international students, as well as foster and deepen their emotional attachment to Singapore while they are here.

Through focus group discussions and surveys, we strive to understand the needs and challenges faced by our students in order to support them and plan the programme to enhance their school experiences.

Programmes include experiences such as learning journeys  to culturally rich places to help them better understand local culture, social norms and also build a social network of support through interactive bonding sessions. 

We also incorporate a buddy system for them to help ease their transition to the school. 

Through these efforts, we hope to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for these students so that meaningful learning can take place and they will become well-adjusted members of society with a sense of belonging to Singapore.

**Celebration of Life**

Celebration of Life is a platform for students to discuss and share what they have learned through the weekly reading of selected contemporary issues. Through the reading and discussion of these contemporary issues, we hope to 

1. provide our students with the knowledge, skills and values to understand Singapore's history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation's future.
    
2.  allow for individual sense-making, to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.
    
3.  help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans and foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which will motivate them to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.
