#### FUTURE-ORIENTED CITIZENSHIP

National Education is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions which enable Pasirians to realise their part in the success of the community and nation:  

*   A sense of belonging: With the changing social fabric and continually evolving national identity, students need to develop a deeper awareness of who they are as Singaporeans and a nation, as well as a shared understanding of the “common good” for all as a nation. 
*   A sense of reality: It is important for students to be aware of and understand Singapore’s constraints, vulnerabilities and the contemporary realities that confront us as a country amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world. 
*   A sense of hope: It is critical for our citizenry to continue to have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future, and resilience to face the challenges ahead.

**Programmes to Develop Citizenship Dispositions in Pasirians**

In order to create holistic learning experiences among Pasirians, a plethora of events and activities are organised throughout the years. These activities include commemoration of Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, National Day and NRIC Presentation Ceremony. With these programmes, we hope that Pasirians’ understanding of their identity and convictions as citizens will be developed as they lead and participate actively. As for our international students, rich programmes such as visit to Supreme Court and musicals based on historical figures are also organised in order to help them better integrate and understand Singapore’s history and heritage.

**Integration Programme**  

The Integration Programme is catered to our international students, as well as students who are Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs).

  

The programme aims to increase awareness of the importance of integration and help newcomers adapt to the Singaporean way of life by facilitating the formation of friendships and shared experiences among local and international students, as well as foster and deepen their emotional attachment to Singapore while they are here.

  

Through focus group discussions and surveys, we strive to understand the needs and challenges faced by our students in order to support them and plan the programme to enhance their school experiences.

  

Programmes include experiences such as learning journeys to culturally rich places such as 

1.  museums, 
2.  visits to local attractions, 
3.  participation in interschool workshops and 
4.  musical events 

to help them better understand local culture and social norms.   

  

We also incorporate a buddy system for them to help ease their transition to the school. 

Through these efforts, we hope to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for these students so that meaningful learning can take place and they will become well-adjusted members of society with a sense of belonging to Singapore.

**Celebration of Life**

Celebration of Life is a platform for students to share what they have learnt through their life experiences and how being grounded on values, developing good social emotional skills and positive attitudes have helped them to overcome their challenges in life. Through the process, speakers will learn to be more reflective of their experiences while at the same time practise their public speaking skills. As listeners, we hope that through these sharing, we will be able to learn from the mistakes and experiences of others, improve on our own character, and develop their Citizenship Dispositions

n 2020, Celebration of Life was don differently in an effort to strengthen students’ voice. Each week, students will read one or two curated newspaper article(s) before engaging in discussion with their peers. From the discussion, they discuss and identify the life lessons that can be gleaned from the article and reflect on how they can do their part as citizens to improve the situation e.g. climate change. Through these discussions, we hope to be able to develop the Citizenship Dispositions of all Pasirians.
