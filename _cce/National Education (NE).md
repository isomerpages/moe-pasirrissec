#### FUTURE-ORIENTED CITIZENSHIP

National Education is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions which enable Pasirians to realise their part in the success of the community and nation:  

*   A sense of belonging: With the changing social fabric and continually evolving national identity, students need to develop a deeper awareness of who they are as Singaporeans and a nation, as well as a shared understanding of the “common good” for all as a nation. 
*   A sense of reality: It is important for students to be aware of and understand Singapore’s constraints, vulnerabilities and the contemporary realities that confront us as a country amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world. 
*   A sense of hope: It is critical for our citizenry to continue to have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future, and resilience to face the challenges ahead.
