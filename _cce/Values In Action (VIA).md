**Values in Action (VIA)** are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA at Pasir Ris Secondary aims to develop caring and resilient Pasirians who actively contribute to the community. VIA projects create awareness of social and environmental issues and provide opportunities for students to espouse the school values of empathy and zeal. Students will also be able to apply the knowledge and skills learnt through formal and non-formal curriculum in their outreach. Through their involvement, students will reflect on their service experiences and have a better understanding and appreciation of what it takes to be socially responsible.
