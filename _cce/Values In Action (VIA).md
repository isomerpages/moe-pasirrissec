### Values In Action @ PRSS

VALUES IN ACTION (VIA) at Pasir Ris Secondary aims to develop caring and resilient Pasirians who actively contribute to the community. Guided by the themes from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG), VIA projects create awareness of social and environmental issues and provide opportunities for students to espouse the school values of empathy and zeal through advocacy projects and outreach, both at the upper and lower secondary. Through their involvement, students will reflect on their service experiences and have a better understanding and appreciation of what it takes to be socially responsible.

#### ECO Stewardship

Through purposeful partnerships with external organizations like Outward Bound School and Ocean Purpose Project, our students participate actively and advocate for the responsible use of natural resources and protection of the natural environment through coastal clean-up projects and upcycling. Students’ outreach includes sharing about recycling and upcycling to primary school and kindergarten students in our community.

Students’ advocacy projects on Zero Hunger, one of the UNSD goals to help bring about actions to help lower income families with food insecurity. Students help to create awareness among schoolmates and rally support through food drives in school, or rallying classmates to volunteer and render their services to the various organizations.
