<h3><strong>School Vision</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Confident Learners, Caring &amp; Resilient Citizens</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to nurture every Pasirian to become a:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Confident Learner:</strong> one who is inquisitive, motivated,
reflective,&nbsp;thinks critically, communicates effectively and owns his
or her learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caring and Resilient Citizen:</strong> one who embraces challenges
and has the moral courage to make a positive difference to the lives of
others.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>School Mission</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Inspiring Lives, Nurturing Talents, Realising Dreams</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe that every student can learn and grow. Teachers hold the key
to unlock the hearts and minds of our students. It is therefore imperative
for teachers to model the way for Pasirians, guide them to be anchored
on core values and purpose, teach them the requisite skills and knowledge
to be future-ready and develop their potential to the fullest so that they
will have a zest for life, the passion to learn, the confidence to lead
and the resilience to navigate the complexities in life to become the future
of Singapore.</p>
