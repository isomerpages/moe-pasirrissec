Pasir Ris Secondary School was the first secondary school established in Tampines on 2nd January 1985. We had our humble beginnings with 11 Secondary One classes and 16 teaching staffs at Chongzheng Primary School, our temporary school site.

Four months later, the school moved to its new school building at its present location at Tampines Street 21. It was a significant milestone as we embarked on a new journey in the education landscape in Singapore. On 20 August 1987, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Defence) and Member of Parliament for Tampines, Mr. Phua Bah Lee, officially opened the school.
  
Our founding Principal, Ms. Bandara, crafted the school motto, Pride and Responsibility, together with some staff members. The aim was to ensure that every Pasirian embraces these values as he or she works towards success and excellence.

In 1997, the building extension project started immediately after the GCE ‘O’ Level examination to add more classrooms for the school to go single session in 2000. The school began its single session on 2nd January 2000 with thirty-nine classes.

As the enrolment of the school increased steadily, it was identified for PRIME upgrading from Jan 2006 to Dec 2007 so that there will be more classrooms and facilities to accommodate the growing school population and learning needs of our students.

We officially moved back to our current location in January 2008, where we made use of the new facilities and opportunities to enhance pedagogical practices and co-curricular programmes to bring the school to greater heights.

The school has achieved many accolades and significant milestones over the few decades such as the Academic Value-added Award and the Sustained Achievement Award in Aesthetics, Sports, and Uniformed Groups.

Today, Pasir Ris Secondary School has established a strong presence in the community and is known for our nurturing and caring staff, effective curricular programmes, and engaging co-curricular activities.
 
We have come a long way since 1985 and are committed to continuing our mission in providing quality education and a conducive environment for every student to grow and succeed in a rapidly changing world.
