## **School Motto** 

<img src="/images/logo%20(3).png" style="width:45%;float:left">

#### **Pride and Responsibility**

Our school logo reflects the type of education the school
aims to provide for our students.

Our Motto, Pride, and Responsibility, derived from the initials of the school, are core values which we hope to instil in our students. These virtues, like sails in the wind, will help Pasirians move forward as Confident Learners, Caring and Resilient Citizens. The waves which form the base on which Pride and Responsibility rest, symbolise the students' development and growth in navigating complexities through a holistic education.  
  
## **School Colours**
  
The school colours, *yellow and green*, represent the *freshness and enlightenment* a sound education provides. It is the schoolâ€™s aspiration to provide the best possible education for our students to ensure that the future generations of Singapore citizens will show pride in their pursuits and shoulder their responsibilities with commitment and dedication.

## **School Song**

<p align="center">
With pride and joy let us sing <br>
Let truth and sincerity come right from your heart <br>
These and other thoughts we gladly bring <br> 
To Pasir Ris right from the start <br><br>
There's care and service we offer <br> 
Give kindness to everyone and grudging to none  <br>
These and other deeds to you we proffer  <br>
Realizing the best from everyone  <br><br>
	<b>Chorus</b><br>	
Have pride in self and concern for others  <br>
But never from the good to stray away  <br><br>
With pride and joy let us sing  <br>
Let truth and sincerity come right from your heart  <br>
These and other thoughts we gladly bring  <br>
To Pasir Ris right from the start  <br>
To Pasir Ris right from the start! <br>
