### **19th School Advisory Committee (1 August 2023 - 31 July 2025)**

The School Advisory Committee (SAC) kicked off its 19th term of service with 8 members with the sole objective of serving the school in their areas of expertise. Over the years, many of them have not only contributed their ideas generously but have been most forthcoming in providing opportunities for our Pasirians to work with the community at large, thereby enriching their education and nurturing the whole child. We are indeed grateful for the services of the following members:
