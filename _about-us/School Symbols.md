**School Motto: Pride & Responsibility**  
  
Our Motto, Pride, and Responsibility, derived from the initials of the school, are core values which we hope to instil in our students. These virtues, like sails in the wind, will help Pasirians move forward as Confident Learners, Caring and Resilient Citizens. The waves which form the base on which Pride and Responsibility rest, symbolise the students' development and growth in navigating complexities through a holistic education.  
  
**School Crest**  
  
Our School logo reflects the type of education our aims to provide its student.  
  
**School Colours**  
  
The school colours, yellow and green, are indicative of the freshness and enlightenment that a sound education provides. It is the school's aspiration to provide the best possible education for its students so as to ensure that our future generation of citizens will show pride in workmanship and shoulder responsibilities efficiently.

**School Song**  

With pride and joy let us sing  
Let truth and sincerity come right from your heart  
These and other thoughts we gladly bring  
To Pasir Ris right from the start  
  
There's care and service we offer  
Give kindness to everyone and grudging to none  
These and other deeds to you we proffer  
Realizing the best from everyone  
  
Have pride in self and concern for others  
But never from the good to stray away  
  
With pride and joy let us sing  
Let truth and sincerity come right from your heart  
These and other thoughts we gladly bring  
To Pasir Ris right from the start
