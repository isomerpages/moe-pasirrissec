“Once a Pasirian, Always a Pasirian”
------------------------------------

Members of the Alumni who are professionals in their respective fields of work are invited to the school to conduct Career Awareness Talks to inspire the current students to make informed choices for Post-Secondary education and future careers. The alumni also supports the school in various events such as CCA sessions and public performances which in turn nurtures and enhances camaraderie amongst former and current students and staff of the school.  

  

Here are some of our outstanding alumni who have excelled in their endeavours and demonstrated values imparted by the school.  These featured Pasirians serve as role models for our students.  Their examples serve to inspire and motivate our students to excel both in their academic pursuit and in their personal life.
