The PSG meetsÂ termly to support each other, meet up with school personnel and enhance student experiences in school through various projects. For example, the members of the PSG have contributed their time, effort and talents during school events, such as Chinese New Year Hamper and Racial Harmony Day, and will lend their support to school initiatives. In 2022, the PSG rallied together to do their part for the community in the Box of Blessings project by donating stationery items to Children's Homes and orphanages.
