A warm welcome to Pasir Ris Secondary School and congratulations on your child's successful completion of Primary School.

A new chapter of your child's life is about to begin and all of us are pleased that you have chosen PRSS as your partner for the next significant milestone in your child's education and preparation for the future.

Here at Pasir Ris Secondary, we are committed to offer a conducive environment to bring out the best in all our students. As the first secondary school to be established in Tampines in 1985, we strive to provide quality learning and development opportunities to nurture confident learners, caring and resilient citizens, grounded on sound values and key principles of holistic education.  In tandem with the changing profiles of learners, our school has introduced 1-1 PLD (Personal Learning Device) in 2019 or PDLP in 2020 to cater to the needs of digital learners and nurture confident self-directed learners who are able to collaborate and connect with others.  This will go a long way to prepare students well for the future amidst the new normal and to embrace lifelong learning.  

Over the years, we have been successful in nurturing our Pasirians to excel in both academic and co-curricular areas. Our key approach is to mould students’ character through designing and customising our programmes to help them cultivate the desired school values of Pride, Responsibility, Integrity, Zeal & Empathy, build their socio-emotional competencies to navigate the complexities in adolescence and to realise their aspirations.  

We strongly believe that parents have a very important role to play in the education and development of our youths. Close partnership between the home and school is key to our students’ development and success.  Our staff especially the Year Heads and Home Teachers will work hand-in-hand with you as I believe our collective wisdom will go a long way to help your child learn and grow. For a start, I seek your help to take an active interest in your child’s growth and ensure that he/she maintains good conduct at all times, attends school regularly and punctually and is engaged meaningfully after school hours.  

To be more involved in your child’s education, you may want to consider joining the Parent Support Group (PSG) or attend the parenting workshops to learn good parenting tips and interact with the school leaders and teachers at regular intervals to exchange views and knowledge of your child’s experiences at school.  

We look forward to partner you in the growth and development of your child.  

Thank You and Best Wishes
