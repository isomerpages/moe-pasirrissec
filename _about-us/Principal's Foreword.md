I see much to be grateful for as a new member of the Pasir Ris Secondary School (PRSS) family. Under the leadership of Mrs Grace Chua, coupled with the efforts of the PRSS team, it is evident that we have stayed true to our mission of inspiring lives, nurturing talents, and realising dreams. Over the past 40 years, cohorts of Pasirians have passed through our gates and emerged as more confident learners and caring individuals.

We now exist in a phase of greater geopolitical tensions coupled with disruptions brought about by accelerating technological advances. Now, more than ever, we must prepare our students as adaptive and resilient individuals, who believe that they have a responsibility in making our communities and nation thrive in the years to come.

To this end, my team and I will stay the course of nurturing caring and resilient Pasirians. As educators, we will continue to sharpen our craft to provide a range of learning experiences to cater to the diverse interests and needs of our students. We aim to increase our students’ cultural appreciation and sense of rootedness via our music and the performing arts experiences. All students will be exposed to a variety of art forms, and students with greater interest and aptitude will be given more opportunities to extend their learning. In addition, we strive to strengthen our students’ sense of reality and nationhood via our overseas twinning programme with several Asian countries. We believe in the importance for our students to have an authentic platform to develop their cross-cultural skills to be better citizens.

It is important for us to build future skills in our students through the academic curriculum. We have integrated the use of technology in our teaching as a vehicle to develop the digital literacies of our students. Our teachers also model the way by experimenting with new methods to make teaching customised and engaging for students. We also provide interdisciplinary learning opportunities for our students to develop critical thinking and collaboration opportunities. To this end, we continue to provide our students with a range of learning opportunities to develop learning dispositions to pursue lifelong learning.

I am honoured to be part of the PRSS family. I invite you – parents, community partners, colleagues and Pasirians – to be part of the next phase of our journey of inspiring lives, nurturing talents and realising dreams so that we can contribute to a thriving Singapore of tomorrow.

Serving with Pride &amp; Responsibility,

Ivan Wu
