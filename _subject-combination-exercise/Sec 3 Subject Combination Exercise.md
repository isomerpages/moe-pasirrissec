<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Sec 3 Subject Combination Exercise provides students with the opportunity
to choose a subject combination they would like to pursue at the Upper
Secondary levels (in addition to the compulsory subjects they are required
to take), based on academic merit first and interest in subjects offered.</p>
<p>This facilitates a deeper study in preferred subjects, preparing students
for post-secondary education in JCs, Polytechnics, and ITEs. Hence, students
should make their choices based on their aptitude, interest, career considerations,
learning styles and dispositions.</p>
<p>The exercise will take place after the End-of-Year examinations, and the
allocation of combinations is based on academic merit as demonstrated in
the overall academic performance at Sec 2 and teacher recommendations.</p>
<p>All subject combinations offered are carefully curated to help pave the
way for students to pursue post-secondary courses at the various tertiary
educational institutions.</p>
<p>This site pulls together various resources which would help you make a
sound decision with regards to the subject combination to pursue and is
organised in the following manner:</p>
