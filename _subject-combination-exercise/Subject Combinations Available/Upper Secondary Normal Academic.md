</p><h3 id="section-1">Humanities</h3>
Upper Secondary students must read at least one Humanities subject. If the student is reading only one Humanities subject, he MUST take ‘Humanities’, comprising a compulsory Social Studies component (SS) and an Elective component. In PRSS, the options for the Elective component are Elective History (EHist) and Elective Geography (EGeo).

<h3 id="section-2">Social Studies</h3>
Social Studies is the compulsory half of the Humanities subject.
<br><br>
At the heart of the Social Studies Curriculum is the preparation of students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the <b>interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in</b>, and appreciate <b>the complexities of the human world</b>. Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to <b>inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives</b>. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. Social Studies seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The Curriculum therefore envisions students as informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.

<h3 id="section-3">Elective History</h3>
History education in Singapore seeks to develop in students an appreciation of past human experiences, critical awareness of the nature of historical knowledge, and the ability to make connections between the past and present.
<br><br>
In recent years, there has been greater cognizance that historical content and concepts as well as the accompanying historical skills, are important. These lie at the heart of thinking critically about the nature of historical knowledge, which is essential to make better sense of the past. History also plays a critical role in developing students’ own identities through an understanding of history at the personal, national and international levels. The learning of history should spark their curiosity and inspire them with the beliefs, decisions and dilemmas of people in the past. Through historical inquiry, students pose questions about the present by engaging with the past and thus draw connections between both.
<br><br>
The Upper Secondary History syllabuses seek to enable students to be effective citizens and participants in the 21st century. To achieve this, students need to understand how the present world system came into being, and the inter-connectedness of nation-states and peoples. The curriculum also seek to examine the key forces and developments which have shaped international history in the 19th and 20th centuries. Through this syllabus, history students will understand not just concepts such as balance of power, hegemony, geopolitics and nationalism, but also acquire historical thinking skills.
<br><br>
Students reading Elective History will only cover the following unit:
<br>
<ol><li>The Making of the 20th Century Modern World, 1910s–1991.</li></ol>	
<br>

<h3 id="section-4">Elective Geography</h3>
Geography emphasises the integrative study of physical and human environments to enable students to gain better understanding of their own space and other parts of the world. It also focuses on the interconnectedness among groups of people, and between people and their environment.
<br><br>
Generally, in both Pure Geography and Elective Geography, students will be taught skills of gathering and analysing information to understand and explain physical and human phenomena, and other contemporary environmental and social issues that occur in different places and cultures by
<br>
<ul>
<li>interpreting and recognising patterns in geographical data and deduce relationships</li>
<li>organise and present geographic information in a coherent way</li>
<li>analyse, evaluate and synthesise geographical data to make informed and sound decisions.</li>
</ul>
The objective is to develop an inquiring mind to seek answers to issues affecting our lives and the world we live in, and prepared students for their roles as informed citizens in the 21st century and most importantly, inculcate an awareness of appropriate attitudes and values that promotes a positive geographical future; one that ensures the sustainability of our resources, people, country, and planet.

Geography students will cover the syllabus as follows:

<h3 id="section-6">Additional Mathematics</h3>
The syllabus intends to prepare students adequately for O-Level Additional Mathematics. The content is organised into three strands, namely, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry, and Calculus. Besides conceptual understanding and skill proficiency explicated in the content strands, important mathematical processes such as reasoning, communication and application (including the use of models) are also emphasised and assessed.
<br>
<img src="/images/Sec%203%20Subject%20Combi%20Exercise/Additional_Mathematics_Concepts.png">
<br>
At Secondary 3, students from the express Normal (Academic) courses who are interested in mathematics and are more mathematically inclined can take up Additional Mathematics which provides greater breadth and depth of coverage of mathematics topics. The Additional Mathematics syllabuses introduce students to Calculus and Trigonometry besides extending the learning in Algebra and Geometry from the N-Level Mathematics syllabus.
<br><br>
The N(A)-Level Additional Mathematics syllabus aims to enable students who have an aptitude and interest in mathematics to:
<br>
<ul>
<li>acquire mathematical concepts and skills for higher studies in mathematics and to support learning in the other subjects, with emphasis in the sciences, but not limited to the sciences;</li>
<li>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving;</li>
<li>connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and the sciences through applications of mathematics; and appreciate the abstract nature and power of mathematics.</li>
</ul> 
The table below shows the difference between Mathematics and Additional Mathematics:

<h3 id="section-7">Art</h3>
Art inspires self-confidence in students, helping them develop critical, imaginative and creative thinking and process skills for both life and work. The study of Art helps provide a foundation for understanding and evaluating aesthetic intention and artistic skills.
<br><br>	
Students will be able to exercise their cognitive reasoning and their intuition. Students’ cognitive skills, such as language fluency, are enhanced when they talk and write about the works of art they have encountered or created.
<br><br>
The production of Art requires a rigorous process of information analysis. In interpreting Art, students need to synthesise perception, information about the artwork and their own experiences.
<br><br>
In addition, students will be exposed to a diverse range of local, regional and global art and cultures through engaging with artworks, art making and arts professions. This will develop in students a lifelong appreciation and enjoyment of art.
